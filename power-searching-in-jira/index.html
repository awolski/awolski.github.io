In my first four months in the position I haven&rsquo;t really worked closely with my team at all; they&rsquo;re on completely different projects, and they are all just as busy as I am.</p><p>Without knowing a great deal about the work they&rsquo;ve been doing over the last 4-5 months, I needed to generate some metrics to see how each of my team members has performed against their Individual Performance Objectives. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how I was going to do this, until I delved into the world <a href=https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Advanced+Searching>advanced searching in JIRA with JQL</a> (Jira Query Language).</p><p>Our development team uses <a href=https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira>JIRA</a> for issue management, so everyone&rsquo;s work on items is traced (to a degree - we could be using JIRA a lot better). With all most of our work data stored, it was just a matter of extracting the information I needed for the metrics I needed it for.</p><p>Simple search using all of the fields JIRA provides just wasn&rsquo;t cutting it. Searches only allowed me to view issues for the current assignee, or its current status. I needed to know whether issues were assigned to my team members <em>at some point</em> in the last 6 months, or if they had worked on an issue that had passed or failed a code review.</p><p>I&rsquo;d been avoiding using advanced queries in JIRA; it just looked like another language to learn, and felt it would consume too much time to learn it. But I had to extract this data. So I took a deep breath, and dived in.</p><p>I wish I&rsquo;d done so sooner. JQL is so easy to use, and so powerful, especially with auto-complete feature turned on.</p><p>Here are a couple of the measurements I needed, and the queries I used to (help) quantify them:</p><p><strong>Performance objective</strong>: Perform an equal share of code reviews during each sprint.
<strong>Quantified by</strong>: Comparing the number of issues resolved, against the number of code reviews completed, and the individual&rsquo;s contribution to those code reviews.
<strong>Solution</strong>:</p><p>First, retrieve a list of all issues resolved (and therefore should be code reviewed) for the projects on which the individual worked:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell>updated &gt;<span style=color:#f92672>=</span> 2012-06-01 AND project

AND <span style=color:#f92672>(</span>status was Resolved OR status <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> Resolved<span style=color:#f92672>)</span>
ORDER BY updated DESC
</code></pre></div><p>Then, retrieve the issues for which the individual did code reviews:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell>updated &gt;<span style=color:#f92672>=</span> 2012-06-01 AND project IN <span style=color:#f92672>(</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Comma Separated&#34;</span>, <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;List of&#34;</span>, <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Projects&#34;</span><span style=color:#f92672>)</span>

ORDER BY updated DESC
</code></pre></div><p>As a supplement, retrieve how many were actually code reviewed:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell>updated &gt;<span style=color:#f92672>=</span> 2012-06-01 AND project IN <span style=color:#f92672>(</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Comma Separated&#34;</span>, <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;List of&#34;</span>, <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Projects&#34;</span><span style=color:#f92672>)</span>
AND <span style=color:#f92672>(</span>status was Resolved  OR status <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> Resolved<span style=color:#f92672>)</span>
AND <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Reviewer&#39;s Name&#34;</span> is not EMPTY ORDER BY updated DESC<span style=color:#e6db74>`</span>
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Performance objective</strong>: Complete all development tasks in accordance with our coding standards.
<strong>Quantified by</strong>: Issues the individual has worked on and their code review success/failure ratio.
<strong>Solution</strong>:</p><p>How many issues each of them has worked (resolved) on since their mid-year performance review:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell>updated &gt;<span style=color:#f92672>=</span> 2012-06-01 AND status CHANGED TO Resolved BY &lt;username&gt;
ORDER BY updated DESC
</code></pre></div><p>Then how many have been code reviewed:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell>updated &gt;<span style=color:#f92672>=</span> 2012-06-01 AND status CHANGED TO Resolved BY &lt;username&gt;
AND status WAS <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Code Reviewed&#34;</span> AND <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Reviewer&#39;s Name&#34;</span> !<span style=color:#f92672>=</span> &lt;username&gt;
ORDER BY updated DESC
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, how many have didn&rsquo;t pass code review:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell>updated &gt;<span style=color:#f92672>=</span> 2012-06-01 AND status CHANGED TO Resolved BY &lt;username&gt;

AND status CHANGED FROM <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Code Reviewed&#34;</span> TO Reopened
ORDER BY updated DESC
