I usually feel optimistic and determined&mldr; It&rsquo;s a clean slate, a fresh new page of a brand new notebook.</p><p>But as each week and month passes, I tend to lose focus and forget the goals I set out to achieve at the beginning of the year.</p><p>In July this year I had a complete plan laid out about how I would smash my end of year performance review. I was determined to be uber-organised, perform so well and gather so much evidence that quantified my achievements. Come year end I would have the leverage to either push for a significant pay rise, or for the modified hours I want to experiment with (a four day work week).</p><p>And here we are, at the end of the year, and my plans lay in pieces (slight exaggeration) scattered along the weeks and months since July. I performed well throughout the year, I think better than most in my department, but I still lost focus, and to be honest I don&rsquo;t think a push for the pay rise or modified work hours is entirely justifiable.</p><p>So I&rsquo;ve begun to lay the foundations for a better year next year, by using a few newly discovered tools.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve created an <a href=https://ifttt.com/>IFTTT</a> recipe that creates a new note in <a href=https://evernote.com/>Evernote</a> each weekday morning. Today&rsquo;s auto-generated title is &lsquo;Work Notes: Monday November 26, 2012&rsquo;, and the note contains a template for all the things I need to quantify come the end of year performance review:</p><ul><li>A daily work log - this comes in handy for time sheets too.</li><li>Individual performance objectives,</li><li>Development objectives</li><li>Competency review</li><li>Achievements and Feedback</li><li>A checklist of shutdown ritual items</li></ul><p>I have the note open all day long, which keeps it in focus and will (I hope) develop a habit of adding to it regularly throughout the day. When performance review time comes around again next year, if I&rsquo;ve consistently kept on top of recording my daily activities and achievements, then I should have a mountain of evidence to justify my value to the company, and a push for more perks.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awolski.com/tracking-solar-kwh-with-google-spreadsheets-ifttt/>Previous</a>
