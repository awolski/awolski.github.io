I take what I learn and feed into the next month. It&rsquo;s a ritual of continuous improvement, a cadence of accountability, that has served me well. In 2020 I&rsquo;m experimenting with publishing my reflection notes. Here&rsquo;s what happened in February.</p><h2 id=patterns>Patterns</h2><p>I&rsquo;m waking up and <strong>not being able to get back to sleep</strong>. This is happening with increasing regularity, at least once per week, sometimes twice. More often than not this occurs after a full day of coding, or working through a problem. I&rsquo;m going to experiment with a night time ritual and meditation when I do wake up to try and rectify this.</p><p>This year I&rsquo;m experimenting with a <strong>weekly collection</strong> in my Bullet Journal in addition to the monthly collection. It&rsquo;s <strong>not working</strong> as well as I&rsquo;d hoped. Although the weekly spread helps me get organised for the week ahead, that&rsquo;s about all I use it for. I still find the monthly collection too large a time frame, and by the end of the month I&rsquo;ve lost focus, direction and momentum. No decisions made yet, I just need to keep tweaking.</p><p>To a small degree I slipped back into my old habits of being <strong>sucked into my laptop when I&rsquo;m with my kids</strong>, which means I&rsquo;m <strong>not fully engaged</strong> and <strong>available</strong> to them. This is a non-negotiable for me: when I&rsquo;m with my kids my phone and laptop should be away.</p><h2 id=lessons>Lessons</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve started to really understand the <strong>importance of connection</strong>. It&rsquo;s fine to be off social media, which I am, but it&rsquo;s also important not to isolate yourself entirely. Connect. Share. Contribute.</p><p>I <strong>love learning</strong>. In February I spent a few days migrating my website to <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. In the process I learned lots about writing clean and minimal HTML5, how to use meta tags and other <code>&lt;head>&lt;/head></code> content. I loved it. I love learning and getting better at my craft (whatever that craft may be).                         </p><p>I learned that sometimes I have a tendency to <strong>dwell on a negative</strong>. I&rsquo;ve found it beneficial to short-circuit these negative thought patterns with a question like <em>&ldquo;Is this helpful?"</em>. Doing so helps you get out of your head and focus on something else, something to get stuck into, something positive.</p><h2 id=achievements>Achievements</h2><ul><li>I read four books (see below).</li><li>I published six blog posts (see below).</li><li>I migrated my website from Jekyll to Hugo.</li><li>I exercised 26 of 29 days.</li><li>I had <a href=/cold-showers>cold showers</a> on 27 of 29 days.</li><li>I finished my training to become  mentor in the <a href=https://1mm.org.uk>1 Million Mentors</a> program.</li></ul><h2 id=writing>Writing</h2><ul><li><a href=/cold-showers>Cold showers</a></li><li><a href=/january-2020-reflection>January 2020 Reflection</a></li><li><a href=/devops>DevOps</a></li><li><a href=/monzo-to-gsheets>Monzo webhooks to Google spreadsheets</a></li><li><a href=/fs>Fresh starts</a></li><li><a href=/choose-freedom-over-loyalty>Choose freedom over loyalty</a></li></ul><h2 id=reading>Reading</h2><p><a href=https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/>Show Your Work</a> by <strong>Austin Kleon</strong>. Another short but powerful book by Austin Kleon. Enough to motivate me to write the blog posts I did. Share the work you do, how you work, your process, what inspires you. </p><p><a href=https://www.adamgrant.net/give-and-take>Give and Take</a> by <strong>Adam Grant</strong>. A fantastic book about giving, and how doing so tends to not only benefit those on the receiving end of your help. I learned a lot from this book, and the one below, and those lessons couldn&rsquo;t have come at a more pivotal moment in my life. </p><p><a href=https://thiscouldbeourfuture.com/>This Could Be Our Future</a> by <strong>Yancey Strickler</strong>. Another great book which is helping change my outlook on life and the remainder of my time on the planet. Strickler demonstrates (like we don&rsquo;t already know) how capitalism and consumerism is broken, and offers an alternative. Financial maximisation is not the only measure of success.</p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Side_of_the_Mountain>My Side of the Mountain</a> by <strong>Jean Craighead George</strong>. A lovely story of boy who runs away from home (and stays away), learning to eat and sleep and live off the land. The imagery and the lifestyle I created in my head while reading this were spectacular. In a way a life we all hope we could live at some point in our lives. </p><p><img src=/assets/img/february-2020-reading.jpg alt="February reading"></p><h2 id=quotes>Quotes</h2><p>Most of the quotes I record each month go directly from the books I read into my <a href=https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/08/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/>commonplace book</a> in handwritten form. But I really liked the <em>Ten Years of Learning in Three Points</em> from Mr Money Moustache&rsquo;s post <a href=https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2019/12/28/let-the-roaring-2020s-begin/>Let the Roaring 2020s Begin</a>. Points two and three basically boil down to tweaking your life/habits to make it easy to do the things you know will make you happy.</p><h2 id=other>Other</h2><p>I really like <strong>Yancey Strickler&rsquo;s</strong> concept of <a href=https://www.ystrickler.com/bentoism>Bentoism</a>, which introduces a decision making framework which incorporates four different perspectives: Now You, Now Us, Future You and Future Us.</p><p>I gave away my first referral bonus for work introduced by someone I know. I&rsquo;m starting to offer a 5% &lsquo;(of the initial contract) introducer bonus&rsquo; to the introducer of new business that leads to concrete work.</p><p>I gave my wedding suit to charity. I&rsquo;ll never wear it again and someone else may benefit from it. Plus it&rsquo;s too big for me now anyway.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awolski.com/choose-freedom-over-loyalty/>Previous</a>
