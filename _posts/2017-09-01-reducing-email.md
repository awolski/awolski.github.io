> This is your life and it's ending a minute at a time - Fight Club

This quote from Fight Club is an idea I take seriously. It may sound morbid, but it helps me to cull the trivial and shallow from my life, creating more time to focus on what I truly value. Lately, email has been an annoying time thief.

I am increasingly frustrated with the number of emails I have to process. The newsletters I never read, the feature updates for services I don't use, new terms of service, feedback requests, payment confirmations etc. These messages are informational, unactionable, unnecessary. I don't need or want to see them. So I've implemented some strategies to stem the flow.

**Remove the source**

If the source of an email is an account I don't use or need, I delete the account. This has now become a game to see how few online accounts I can live with.

If the message is from, say, a recruiter that can't take a hint, the message is filtered to the trash and they get hit with auto-response:

>Thanks for your message,
>
>I am not currently available for new opportunities. I would appreciate it if you could remove me from, or update my availability details in, the database from which you obtained my contact details.
>
>Best regards,
>Tony

**Stem the flow**

If the message is from a source that can't be removed (an account I can't delete or person I can't turn off), stem the flow. Unsubscribe from all notifications. Block the sender if necessary.

**Filter, filter, filter**

There are some notifications that can't be switched off entirely, e.g. payment notifications, terms of service updates, delivery notifications, etc. For these I add the source address to a filter that marks them as read, archives them, and applies labels them 'Filtered'.

To ensure don't missed anything important, I created a weekly calender event with a link to a Gmail search in the event's description. The link below opens Gmail with messages in the 'Filtered' label that arrived within the last seven days.

```
**Lessons**

These strategies have certainly reduced the amount of manual processing I'm forced to do. Last week there were 20 messages auto-filtered, and those obviously don't include emails from the accounts I've deleted. In turn, my compulsion to check email and to clear my inbox is greatly reduced, resulting in longer distraction-free periods. However I have a feeling this is a stop gap, and doesn't get to the root of the problem. 

Something tells me [eliminating email](https://hbr.org/2016/02/a-modest-proposal-eliminate-email) is closer to the answer. Cal Newport suggests as much [here](http://calnewport.com/blog/2016/03/22/the-case-against-email-strengthens/) and [here](http://calnewport.com/blog/2016/07/20/no-email-no-problem-a-workflow-engineering-case-study/), and personally I can vouch that the lack of email in the workplace not being a problem: I've been consulting at a bank for two months and I still don't have a company email address. This suits me fine... one less input taking valuable minutes from my life, allowing more time for valuable work.
