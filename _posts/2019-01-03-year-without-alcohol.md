You're writing a letter to yourself. To clarify what you've learned, what you've gained. 

**Introduction**

Today marks one year since I gave up alcohol. The decision 
On 4th January 2018 I pulled the trigger on a decision I had been mulling over for months. There are entries in my journal
As I boarded the plane to To mark the occasion I wanted to capture my thoughts about my journey through the last year.

### Why did I give up?

**What it was costing me**

Alcohol had robbed me of too much over the years. Weeks, if not months, had been spent in that hungover haze. Or worse, in bed throwing up all day. With two young children that time is so much more valuable now.

For years I've suffered from post drinking migraines. Headaches that pulsed behind my eyes with such intensity and for so long I would throw up all day. But they weren't consistent. Sometimes I could go out, forget myself, and be perfectly fine the day after. But more and more frequently in recent years I would be struck down after only a glass or two.

I had been thinking about giving up alcohol for quite some time. There are entries in my journal in the months leading up to my decision in which I question myself. I ask myself how many days I'm going to waste before remove it from my life? How many days spent in bed vomiting. How many days missing out spending quality time with the kids? In the end it wasn't a tough decision to make. The scales had tipped so far in favour of sobriety there was no way I could continue along the same path.

I've suffered from post drinking migraines for years now. We call them migraines, but I'm not 100% sure they would be clinically diagnosed as such. I suffered an eye injury playing football in 2001. I don't recall when they started but in the last 10 years I would get intense headaches mostly completely isolated behond my damaged eye. The pain cause me to throw up. Again and again and again, until my stomach was completely empty. Then I'd continue throwing up green bile until around 6pm - 7pm at night, at which time I'd feel well enough to eat and drink something. Usually coke and whatever takeaway I could get my hands on... KFC was a favourite around this time of night.

When the kids arrived our partying slowed down. I was usually careful about how much I drank, well aware of how painful it is to look after children when you're even a little but dusty from the night before. But for me, quantity wasn't a guaranteed way to avoid a hangover. Sometimes I could go out and forget myself, and be somewhat functional the next day. On other occasions a glass or two could induce an eye ache that would completely wipe me out. These were difficult to take. I would be the sensible one, but I'd be the one who paid the ultimate price the next day. And when there are kids involved this situation was just untenable.

**The look back factor**

The thought of getting to the end of my life and realising I'd boozed consistently since I was 16 years old, quite honestly, depressed me. I would never have known the difference between a sober life and one spent tied to the peer pressure, the status quo, the foggy days. What could life have been like if I'd just taken some time out? Not a month, not three months. You can't really get a gauge of another lifestyle if you only undertake it for a few months.

**Curiosity**

I wanted to see what life was like withouth alcohol.  

### How did I do it?

Read a few books. These were invaluable
Had a challenge to focus on
Remained inclusive. I continued to do the things I normally did. Beers at lunch and after work on a Friday.
Alcohol free beers. Some of them aren't the greatest tasting things, but you do feel a little more included with a beer bottle in your hand.
I undertook a significant physical challenge to keep me focused. I lined up training sessions and fabulous breakfasts on Saturday and Sunday mornings. 
I would still come along for beers on a Friday lunchtime, just not as often.
I'd go out for drinks after work on a Friday, but I'd duck out after a couple of hours.

### What have I learned?

Thins I learned:

- I don't like loud bars and clubs
- I LOVE dinners with a few close friends
- I love my mornings. And I get to enjoy so many more of them
- Good friends don't care whether you're drinking or not
- k 


### And now?

So now I know  what a sober life is. And I'm so glad I took the time to learn, because I know choose it.
