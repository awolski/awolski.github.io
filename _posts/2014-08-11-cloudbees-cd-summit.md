I've just registered for the [CloudBees continuous delivery summit](http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit) in London on 9th September.

I've been drawn to continuous integration/delivery ever since I joined a company that had adopted *zero* continuous integration practices; I'm talking a fully manual process from commit, to build, to copy an artefact to a production environment. I implemented a number of improvements there, and brought that experience to my current company, but I still feel like I'm only just scratching the surface. So I was pumped at the prospect of a free seminar with what looks to be a pretty good lineup:

| Time  | Session                                                                            |

I'm just a little bit optimistic that I might get to meet Kohsuke Kawaguchi, the creator of Jenkins. If I had one, he'd probably make my Wall of Legends.

You can check out the blog post about the summit [here](http://blog.cloudbees.com/2014/06/cd-summit-learn-from-continuous.html). All attendees get a copy of [The Pheonix Project](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Phoenix-Project-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B00AZRBLHO) (although I've already read it). There's no mention of the London event on either the web page or the blog post, but you can register for the event at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/how-to-accelerate-innovation-with-continuous-delivery-london-tickets-12229265061).
