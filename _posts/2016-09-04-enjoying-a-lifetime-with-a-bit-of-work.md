I watched the minimalism film for the second time last night. I enjoyed it even more this time around; it certainly won't be the last time I watch it. There is a minimalist's travel bag chock-full of incredible quotes, realisations and real life examples in the film. I really am gravitating more and more to a more minimalist lifestyle, and I can feel the momentum building towards some major lifestyle changes. Some of my friends and family would say that I'm already a minimalist, but I disagree. My answer... How can I be so minimalist when I have still have so much **unnecessary** debt hanging over my head?

I'm drawn to the whole concept of minimalism, tiny houses, efficient spaces, owning and consuming less. To having more time with which I choose to do what I want. A lot of this isn't possible — at least in the immediate future —  because of the lifestyle that myself and my family have, the things we own, and the decisions we've made. Some of it isn't even desirable. I guess what I'm really drawn to is the idea of a more conscious (find another word - starting with d) life, rather than going through the motions, the status quo.

Anyway, the purpose of this post is to ponder one of the (many) quotes that stuck in my head from last night's viewing:

> How do we go from working all throughout our lifetime, to enjoying a lifetime with a bit of work here and there?

Jay Austin — a tiny house designer — asks the question at the XX minute mark from his tiny house (which is *really* tiny). It's a thought that really got my mind turning over (more so than usual).

How do I go from my current work-life situation, in which I work 50, 60, 70 or more hours a week and trying to enjoy fragments of time with my family and friends (non-desirable), to a life-work situation enjoying more of life supported by a little bit of work (desirable)? Before I go any further, I have to say that I really enjoy what I do (software and devops engineer); if I was minted I'd still be coding, designing and problem solving in some capacity.

After the film I sat in bed staring at my finances spreadsheet, playing with figures, trying to figure out how and when this desirable state might be possible (in a realistic, family-approved scenario). The answer? A **lot** sooner than I thought. I'm talking debt free and in a position to choose how much I work *within 2 years*. This is at least 10 years sooner than I thought possible. Obviously plans and habits would have to change, but isn't that this is all about? Isn't making some behaviour changes now worth not *having* to work 50, 60 and 70 hour weeks for another 10 years? Me thinks so...

The momentum of my minimalism boulder has just been given an almighty push.

1. Define a clear purpose

To write a blog post on the following quote:

"How do we go from working all throughout our lifetime to enjoying a lifetime, with a bit of work here and there."

2. Identify a compelling motive

To contribute to the body of knowledge I'm going to create on how to achieve a more simple life, with less.

3. Architect a worthy challenge

Just publish a post already!

4. Provide a conducive environment

At my desk in the bedroom with lights dimmed. Phone on no interruption mode, earplugs in playing deep meditation music. Internet turned off my laptop and all applications shut down except for Atom in single page mode.

5. Allocate a committed block of time

It's now 20:42. I'm allocating 1h 30m.

6. Prevent interruptions and distractions

Em is aware that I'm up here writing, not wanting any distractions. Nobody else is capable of distracting me.

7. Master your tools

My Macbook Pro. The keys are an extension of myself, and I'm fairly fluent in Markdown now.
