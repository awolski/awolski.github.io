title:  "The benefits of waking early - part 2"
---

Last week I wrote about [the benefits of waking early](http://awolski.com/the-benefits-of-waking-early/) in the wake of my recent switch to pre-5:30am starts each day (pardon the pun).

The day after I published my post, my old Crossfit box owner Pete Rankine echoed similar (and more elaborate) sentiments on [The Boat Shed](http://www.theboatshedfitness.co.uk/)'s WOD [blog](http://www.theboatshedfitness.co.uk/2015/03/19/friday-20-03-2015/). Hearing Pete's thoughts really reinforced my own goals, and my drive to continue the habit of waking early.

The whole post is definitely worth a read, but I particularly liked:

>"The number one excuse for not working out is the lack of time. After having a long day at work, going to the gym can easily become a small priority. Waking up before 6 am allows you to hit the gym before starting your workday."

And:

>"Starting your day early builds your confidence and creativity. Every morning after waking up, I get an adrenaline rush. It comes from the simple fact that I’m up turning my dreams into reality while my competition sleeps.

>"I always complete my most pressing tasks before 8 am. By doing so, I’m able to fly through my day with high energy and the feeling of accomplishment. Completing my most essential work first also reduces my levels of stress and anxiety. 

>"The poet Mrs JA Carney once said, “Little drops of water, little grains of sand, make the mighty ocean and the beauteous land.”

>The bottom line: If you can discipline yourself to wake up 2.5 hours earlier every day, your productivity will increase dramatically in the long run.

Kudos to Pete and anyone else that accomplish what few do in their lifetime... be early risers.
