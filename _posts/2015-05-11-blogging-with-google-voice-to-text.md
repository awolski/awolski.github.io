title:  "Blogging with Google voice to text"

Things have been so busy recently that I have been finding it difficult  to create time to write. There just seems to be so much going on in life: family life, kids, work, trying to get a side business off the ground, maintaining some level of fitness by doing a WOD 4 to 5 times a week, let alone all the day to day things that need to get done. Even getting up at 5am, there's only ever an hour or so at the end of the day before I go to bed at 10pm, during which I'm usually getting some coding or reading done.

So I got to thinking, how can I "hack" my way to achieve my goal of blog posting 5 times per week when time is so limited? Squeeze in an hour at work? Write before I go to bed? I was coming up short with viable options.

Then last Friday my new Oneplus One arrived. I played around with it for most of Friday night, and then off and on over the weekend. One thing that I discovered worked amazingly well that I'd never really used before is Google's speech to text functionality. I was gob-smacked at how easy it was to use, and how accurate it was. I soon began to wonder whether it could be the answer to my non-blogging dilemma.

So I 'typed' out this post using it...

But I honestly only had to correct misspellings or mis-hearings 6-7 times. And I spoke this post in a hushed voice (so as no to wake the kids), from my bed, at 21:45 on a Sunday night.

I'm still getting used to it, so I'm no expert just yet. I found a reference to some of the many [punctuation commands](http://android.stackexchange.com/a/66331) you can just say, like "New line", "period" and "comma", and Google voice to text just spits out what you want.
