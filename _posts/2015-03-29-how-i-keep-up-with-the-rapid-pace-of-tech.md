title:  "How I keep up with the rapid pace of tech"
---

I recently attended the London edition of [Thoughtworks' Tech Radar](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) event. I really enjoyed the gathering, as it introduced me to a range of [Techniques](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques), [Tools](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools), [Platforms](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms), [Languages & Frameworks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks). And it was great to the hear the opinions of two really in-touch, smart and interesting guys, including [Ian Cartwright](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ian-cartwright/0/952/282).

One of the questions that was put to the speakers was 
> 'How do you keep up to date with all of these technologies, languages and frameworks?' 

It was a good question, and one to which I could sense the rest of the room interested in hearing the answer. 

One of the speakers' answers was to attend technology conferences as much as possible. Not just language specific ones, but the likes of [QCon](http://qconlondon.com/) which cover a broad range of software development areas.

For me, one key methods I use is to subscribe to Java and technology related feeds. I've built up my current feed list over the years, and because it's constantly evolving as I on-board new feeds and cull old ones, I thought it would be a valuable exercise to post it's current state... you know, for posterity.

Admittedly, my folder organisation leaves a lot to be desired. And there are a number of feeds that need to be culled from this list.

As I read an article it will inevitably link to other sources, so I typically follow it down the rabbit hole until I've satisfied my curiosity for the particular topic. Reading this way also means I stumble across more blogs, and people, that are worthwhile following and adding to my feed.
