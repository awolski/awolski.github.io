At the start of 2015 I set myself a goal to contribute more to the worldwide Java community. Getting involved in community discussions, forums and social media. Responding to more questions on [Stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/). Contributing to an open source project (I'm still yet to choose which one(s)). I also started open sourcing some of the work I've been doing in my spare time. 

As a result of open sourcing one particular [project](https://github.com/awolski/client-api) on [GitHub](https://github.com/), I was contacted by [Stormpath](https://stormpath.com/), asking if they could feature my project on their website. 

Stormpath is:

> "... a User Management API specialising in Authentication, OAuth, Custom User Data, SSO and Authorization. A Complete User System. In Minutes."

It's really easy to get up and running, and removes the need to develop a huge part of an application (User Management) that is necessary, but not part of the business logic.

Just quietly, I was pretty stoked. Stormpath organised a phone interview to go through my web application, and to see how and why I was using their API for user management and security.

After a few months of no contact I thought they must have moved on to bigger and better things, but a little over two weeks ago they emailed again with a draft of the blog post (to which I eagerly gave the thumbs up). Early last week the write up went live! You can view the entire article here: [Exploring Microservices Architectures With Stormpath](https://stormpath.com/blog/exploring-microservice-architectures-with-stormpath/).

The concept that the more you give, the more you get in return, is a strange concept to grasp. And it's one that has taken me a long time to realise. But I can't believe how powerful it really is. I'll certainly be giving to the Java and developer community a lot more in the future.
