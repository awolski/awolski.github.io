Note: I started this post on new year's eve and am only just getting around to finishing it now. Not a good start to my writing year!

2015 is winding down. Em has taken the kids out to a park with a friend and her kids, leaving me with a couple of hours to myself. So I thought I'd reflect on the year was, in writing.

Writing — particularly in the technical arena — was a key focus for me at the start of the year, based on a journal entry I wrote in January. Here's a snippet from that entry:

> Writing has the effect of forcing you to understand a topic, and it conveys that understanding to the rest of the (tech) world (or at least the ones that stumble across your blog).

> My goal in 2015 is to completely leapfrog everyone at my company, become the no-questions-asked go-to guy at *insert_company*, and develop a presence within the worldwide Java community... even if it's just a very small presence.

In total I 'shipped' 27 blog posts (a few more in draft that I never finished), so I certainly didn't reach the level I wanted to at the start of the year. As I look back over the posts I put out (a list of which is below), I feel a little disappointed in what I wrote about, because they don't convey what I actually spent my time working on, or the technologies I worked with. I've come such a long way in so many different areas and I'm really disappointed that this isn't reflected in the content that I've shared. Some of the tech I've spent a great deal of time with this year have been:

* Docker, Docker Machine, Docker Compose
* Cloud Platforms: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Jelastic
* HashiCorp tools: Vagrant, Terraform, Packer and Atlas
* Node.js, NPM and the Node ecosystem
* Atlassian applications: Jira, Confluence, HipChat, Bamboo
* Google Apps (including a great automated user provisioning application using Apps Script) 
* Continuing with Groovy, Java, dabbled in Clojure 
* Other technologies like Intersystems Caché, MUMPs

But in a way I feel positive about my progress, and I feel like I've built a reasonable platform on which to build on in 2016. And on the bright side, even though I'm not publishing as many blog posts, I am writing continuously in the form of daily development journals in Google Drive, which has been a really good habit to adopt. Here's a snapshot of my Daily Files folder:

In 2016 I really want to knock it out of the park in a writing sense. I've set myself a goal to write everyday. In effect I do this, considering the daily development logs I keep, it's just a matter of pulling the interesting, important, helpful parts out of those daily logs and crafting them into something that is shareable. And I've got so many other things that I want to share over and above the technical stuff: my progress on a fitness front (which I'm really nailing at the moment), the reading I'm doing, minimalism and stoicism... 

There are a few pieces of advice in blog posts that I keep revisiting when my writing wanes and I need some inspiration and motivation to put pen to paper, in the digital sense. A couple in particular stick out, Jeff Atwood's [How To Achieve Ultimate Blog Success In One Easy Step](My theory is that lead generation derives from Google rank and that the best way to increase Google rank is to be like a professional fighter: neither jabs nor haymakers are enough. You must be always jabbing and you must regularly throw haymakers. Blog continuously to keep your hit-rate and link-traffic high and write longer pieces, containing the high-value words associated with your niche, occasionally.) and [Always. Be Shipping.](http://blog.codinghorror.com/yes-but-what-have-you-done/). Both draw references from other posts and articles which are amazing in their own right, but Atwood does a great job of getting across the message I need drummed in.

Here's a jab.
