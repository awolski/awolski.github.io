This questioned was put to me by a friend on a recent night out (pint of cider in his hand) about the purpose of my dry year, which I'm nearly half way through. My initial, unconvincing response was that, at the very least, I'll have completed a [70.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_70.3). To which he again queried "You couldn't have done that anyway?"

His playful jibe, and my weak response, got me thinking deeper about my decision. What do I really want out of this year, and could that be obtained with alcohol along for the ride?

My answer is no.  

**365 fresh mornings**. In which I've exercised, read, journaled, and worked on my goals. These mornings, which I love, are stripped away by alcohol, late nights, and hangovers. By the time my post-night-out-self is dragging himself out of bed to 'deal' with the kids in the morning, my alcohol-free-self already has two hours of these valuable activities under his belt, and greets his kids with smiles and loving hugs when they get up. 

**Confidence** to **enjoy myself**, and **relax**, **without a drink**. Drinking is not a prerequisite to having a great night with friends. Conversations and laughter make socialising great, not the drink in our hand. When I sit down to watch a movie with my wife, a glass of wine isn't necessary to fully unwind. Alcohol is part of the having a good time puzzle, but it's not. We've just made the association from a young age, and never given ourselves the opportunity to test the theory. I've tested the theory, and it doesn't hold.

**Clarity**. So much time is lost to the haze of intoxication, hangover and recovery, during which time our goals and best intentions are put on hold. Often take a step backwards. However with sobriety comes clarity, and clarity equals success. 

A **healthier bank balance**. This outcome would be more so if I wasn't spending all of my money on the kit required for triathlons, but alcohol costs. The drinks you consume are expensive enough, but when you add on the rounds you buy for others, the takeaways, taxis, costs for replacing lost items etc., well, let's just say I'll be much better off financially this year.

**Energy for my kids**. One of the catalysts for giving up alcohol this year was eliminating hangover-induced lost time with my kids. I no longer wanted to stick the kids in front of a movie so I could recover on the couch next to them. I want my kids to grow up with, and remember, a playful, energetic father, and alcohol simply doesn't allow this.
 
**Broken the cycle**. I've been in this cycle, without really thinking about it, since I was 16-17. That's 22+ years! I wanted to experience what life is like on the other side of alcohol (it's pretty bloody good). I will have broken the cycle. 

TODO: Could I have these things with alcohol? You might argue yes, you could. But my answer is **no**. History backs me up. To an extent. To the same extent that I've achieved them in the past. Partially. In a stop start way. Maybe some of it. Maybe partially. The intent would be there. But alcohol taketh away. Alcohol delays... until tomorrow, until next week, until next month or next year. I want these things now.

The list above won't mean much to my sceptical mate, or the many others who have shown their disbelief (even disapproval) at my decision. And that's fine, because it has taken 22 years for me to get here. To pluck up the guts to say enough is enough. To run in the opposite direction to the crowd. I can't expect anyone else to 'get it' overnight. Maybe this post will help them understand.

As Derek Sivers says in [Some will always say you're wrong](https://sivers.org/wrong):

> "You have to know your preferences well, because no matter what you do, **someone will tell you you’re wrong**"

In the last five months I've developed, and continue to develop, the ability and the confidence to do what he follows up with:

> ...if you **expect this criticism in advance**, and **take pride in your stance**, you can bash on with a smile, being who you want to be.

And that's the biggest thing that I'm getting out of this. A greater sense of self. Feeling comfortable with who I am. I've thought a lot about my relationship with alcohol in the past, because it has cost me so much (in terms of lost days). But I was always worried about how it might affect my relationships

> Then every time they say you’re wrong, that’s a sign you’re doing it right.

I couldn't have said it better myself.
