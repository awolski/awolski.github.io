title:  "Your choices shape your identity"

> Every time you choose to do the easy thing, instead of the right thing, you are shaping your identity, becoming the type of person who does what’s easy, rather than what’s right. — Hal Elrond, [The Miracle Morning][the-miracle-morning]

I highlight a lot of passages and take a lot of notes as I read. Some passages I highlight are forgotten shortly after consumption. Others remain firmly lodged in my mind, and go on to influence my thoughts and actions for weeks, months and years. Occasionally something I read threatens to shape the person I am and who I become for the rest of my life. The above is one of the latter.

How often do you let a single bad day ruin the rest of your week? You eat something shit, you miss a workout, or you fail to do something you promised yourself you would do. But instead of rectifying the failing today, you vow that you'll get back on track next week. "Next week will be a good week. Next week I'll smash it."

Bullshit.

Choosing to start your life next week defines you as someone who puts things off and does what's easy. You might think it's not that big a deal, but you're literally shaping your identity.

You also miss an opportunity. Every time something doesn't go the way you want, you have the opportunity to grow. To do the hard thing. The define yourself as someone who just gets things done, regardless of how difficult it is. And choosing this option is like compound interest, it builds and builds.

I've recently used this knowledge — that my choices define who I am — to avoid doing what's easy, and instead choosing to 'just get it done.' To keep my don't-break-the-chain workout log going when I felt it was too late in the day for a WOD. To write when I was tired. The start the day with the right food choices despite having a weak moment the day before.

Day after day, week after week, you can either be building or slipping. You have the opportunity at each and every choice which path you're on.
