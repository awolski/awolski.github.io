### My problem with digital

Digital organisational tools don't work because of their very digital nature. They're online, which means distraction. Temptation to check email, blogs, Hacker News, actual news. In that moment after I've cleared my inbox or task list my thought process goes someting like this: 

> _"It won't hurt if you spend 5 minutes scanning the first page or two of Hacker News! What's the big deal? Stop worrying and live a little."_

That's my pleasure driven brain talking, and at that point in time it's in complete control. Like when I'm on my way to the freezer to pinch some of my wife's Lindt chocolate. My rational, pre-planning brain is nowhere to be seen. Five  minutes turns into thirty down rabbit holes chasing new ideas and rubbish news. I end up with more on the shelves of my cluttered brain than I started, when the reason I got online in the first place was to clear those shelves.


### What the Bullet Journal method promises

What I like most about the Bullet Journal method is its simplicity. So many digital organsiation tools have come and gone from my life because of their complexity or rigidness. With the Bullet Journal, all you need is a pen and a notebook. Once you understand the basic signifiers, collections, and migrations, you're good to go. And simple things are more likely to stand the test of time.

The Bullet Journal method encourages you to extract yourself from the whirlwind of daily life. To stop and think. As the strapline states:To reflect on the past, current and the future (insert actual blurb). To ask yourself questions. There is no better way to do this type of reflection than on paper.

I've been journaling for years. I love the clarity it brings to my life. But ideas spawned from my journal stayed lost on those pages, possibly never to be looked at again. I didn't have a mechanism to migrate those ideas into a planning or organisation system. To act on them. The Bullet Journal method is the missing link between free-form journaling (**reflection**) and a system to **plan** and put those ideas into **action**.

My Bullet Journal has become my single source of truth.

### Benefits so far

The changes I've noticed since starting Bullet Journaling have been remarkable. 

**I'm sleeping better** — I close out the day by reviewing what I've done, thinking about what still needs to be done. I make some notes about what happened that day. What's on my mind. And then I close my journal with a clear mind and generally sleep like a baby.

**I'm getting way more done** — Something.

**I feel clearer** — I know I'm working on the most important thing

**I've removed so much** — Something
