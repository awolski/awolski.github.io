I was putting the finishing touches on the blog post I wrote yesterday about [enjoying a lifetime with a bit of work][enjoying-a-lifetime-with-a-bit-of-work] and found myself on Jay Austin's blog reading his recent posts. Aside from the initial pang of jealousy I had about the amount of travel he enjoys, I was struck by a couple of quotes and how closely they aligned the direction I'm taking my life.

In his post [Recap, Reboot][jay-austin-recap-reboot] he muses:

> the little house wasn't an ends, but a means: a means to live a clutter-free life and a debt-free life—and later, a carbon-free life—a house that wouldn't tie me down with financial and physical and mental burdens

And later:

> ...about getting from trapped to untrapped, inhibited to uninhibited, about the big changes I've made-but-haven't-actually-yet-written-about that have helped me live a more intentional life

Getting from **trapped to untrapped**... big changes that have helped me live a **more intentional life**. To **live a clutter-free life** and a **debt-free** life. These are the outcomes and ideals that occupy my mind, and I've begun [writing about][enjoying-a-lifetime-with-a-bit-of-work] and working towards.

Another blog has just been added to my feed, and I'll be looking forward to reading about the decisions and changes Jay made along the way..
