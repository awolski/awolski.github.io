It certainly won&rsquo;t be the last time I watch it. There is a minimalist&rsquo;s travel bag chock-full of incredible quotes and realisations, and inspiring people and real life examples in the film.</p><p>I really am gravitating more and more to a more minimalist lifestyle, and I can feel the momentum building towards some major lifestyle changes. Some of my friends and family would say that I&rsquo;m already a minimalist, but I disagree. My answer&mldr; How can I be so minimalist when I have still have so much <strong>unnecessary</strong> debt hanging over my head?</p><p>I&rsquo;m drawn to the whole concept of minimalism, tiny houses, efficient spaces, owning and consuming less. To having more time with which I choose to do what I want. A lot of this isn&rsquo;t possible right now, because of the lifestyle that myself and my family have, the things we own, and the decisions we&rsquo;ve made. Some of it isn&rsquo;t even desirable. I guess what I&rsquo;m really drawn to is the idea of a more deliberate life, rather than going through the motions. Bucking the status quo so to speak</p><p>Anyway, the purpose of this post is to ponder one of the (many) quotes that stuck in my head from last night&rsquo;s viewing:</p><blockquote><p>How do we go from working all throughout our lifetime, to enjoying a lifetime with a bit of work here and there?</p></blockquote><p><a href=http://www.jayaustin.info/>Jay Austin</a> — a tiny house designer — asks the question (at 18:22) from <a href=http://www.jayaustin.info/p/blog-page_20.html>the Matchbox</a> (his own <em>really</em> tiny, carbon-nuetral and off-the-grid house). It&rsquo;s a thought that really got my mind turning over (more so than usual).</p><p>How do I go from my current work-life situation, in which I work 50, 60, 70 or more hours a week and trying to enjoy fragments of time with my family and friends (non-desirable), to a life-work situation enjoying more of life supported by a little bit of work (desirable)?</p><p>And I&rsquo;m not just like &ldquo;that grass is so much greener.&rdquo; I really enjoy what I do (I&rsquo;m software/devops engineer). If I was minted I&rsquo;d still be coding, designing and problem solving in some capacity. Just less. And not because I have to in order to pay the bills.</p><p>After the film I sat in bed staring at my finances spreadsheet, playing with figures, trying to figure out how and when this desirable state might be possible (in a realistic, family-approved scenario). The answer? A <strong>lot</strong> sooner than I thought. I&rsquo;m talking debt free and in a position to choose how much I work <em>within 2 years</em>. This is at least 10 years sooner than I thought possible. Obviously plans and habits would have to change, but isn&rsquo;t that this is all about? Isn&rsquo;t making some behaviour changes now worth not <em>having</em> to work 50, 60 and 70 hour weeks for another 10 years? Me thinks so&mldr;</p><p>The momentum of my minimalism boulder has just been given an almighty push.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awol.ski/docker-compose-slow-with-docker-for-mac-and-public-wifi/>Previous</a>
