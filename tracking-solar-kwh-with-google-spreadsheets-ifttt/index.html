Sixteen panels in total, thirteen split over two sections of the roof and five on the garage, totalling a 4kW system. I hadn&rsquo;t considered solar when we bought the house, but fortunately we have south-east and south-west facing sides of the house, and after a little research, solar turned out to be the best investment with the money available to invest.</p><p>I check the meter every now and again to see how many kWhs we&rsquo;re producing. I&rsquo;ve been surprised by the output on some days, and a little disappointed on others. One glorious October day we almost hit 16kWh. However on the frequent cloudy days here in the UK we&rsquo;re barely able produce 1 or 2kWh. Two days ago I thought the system had stopped altogether.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/2012-11-22-solar-panels.jpg alt="Solar Panels"></p><p>I decided it would be valuable to have a record of how the system is performing. In particular, to compare what we&rsquo;re producing against the forecasts in the proposal given to us before the system was installed. Currently I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s performing as well as I&rsquo;d hoped. I would like to get a better idea of whether that is due to the weather or the system.</p><p>So in order to track the solar generation, I set up a Google Spreadsheet where I&rsquo;ll record the meter reading each day. But in order to help with the weather side of things, I set up an IFTTT recipe to record some of the day&rsquo;s weather details. Each morning at sunrise, IFTTT appends a row to the spreadsheet with the date, time of sunrise, forecast minimum and maximum temperature for the day, and the current condition.</p><p>This setup should give me a good starting point for keeping track of how the system performs in certain weather conditions. The weather details I&rsquo;m gathering aren&rsquo;t exactly what I am after, but you&rsquo;ve got to start somewhere.</p><p>This is my first IFTTT recipe; let&rsquo;s see if it inspires me to more interesting uses.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awol.ski/power-searching-in-jira/>Previous</a>
