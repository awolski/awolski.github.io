Founded in March 2020 with my co-founder Iván Perdomo, Yvant is a DevOps consultancy that helps its clients run on less, produce more and deliver faster. We&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with setup activities and working with our first client. Things are going well and I&amp;rsquo;m excited for what&amp;rsquo;s in store, not only for us but also for our clients.
I have also become a teacher (unofficially).</description></item><item><title>Work</title><link>https://awolski.com/work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/work/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software/devops engineer with twenty years of experience in a range of industries. I love learning and solving complex problems with simple solutions. I started out as a Java developer but gravitated towards continuous delivery, process improvement and automation (apparently now called DevOps). I focus on getting code into production as fast and safe as possible.
Most recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with AWS, Terraform, Docker, Node.js, Groovy and MySQL. However, over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve built up experience with a wide array of cloud platforms, programming languages, automation tools and practices.</description></item></channel></rss>
