I select charities recommended by organisations such as Effective Altruism and Give Well to maximise my donations and turn them into real action.
This page exists not to boast, but to hold myself accountable. It&amp;rsquo;s an implementation intention.
Why? I&amp;rsquo;ve been incredibly fortunate. I was born in a safe and prosperous country, raised by loving parents, siblings, extended family and friends.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://awolski.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/about/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://awolski.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/contact/</guid><description>I can be contacted via email at tony@awolski.com.</description></item><item><title>What I’m doing now</title><link>https://awolski.com/now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/now/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on my new business yvant.io. Founded in March 2020 with my co-founder Iván Perdomo, Yvant is a DevOps consultancy that helps its clients run on less, produce more and deliver faster. We&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with setup activities and working with our first client. Things are going well and I&amp;rsquo;m excited for what&amp;rsquo;s in store, not only for us but also for our clients.
I have also become a teacher (unofficially).</description></item><item><title>Work</title><link>https://awolski.com/work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/work/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software/devops engineer with twenty years of experience in a range of industries. I love learning and solving complex problems with simple solutions. I started out as a Java developer but gravitated towards continuous delivery, process improvement and automation (apparently now called DevOps). I focus on getting code into production as fast and safe as possible.
Most recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with AWS, Terraform, Docker, Node.js, Groovy and MySQL. However, over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve built up experience with a wide array of cloud platforms, programming languages, automation tools and practices.</description></item></channel></rss>
