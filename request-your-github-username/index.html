It&rsquo;s nice (though increasingly rare) to have the same username on all the sites you use on the web. But unless you&rsquo;ve got some random mashing of letters and numbers, it&rsquo;s difficult to &lsquo;nab&rsquo; your preferred username.</p><p>When I joined GitHub, this was the case for me. <a href=https://github.com/awolski>awolski</a> was gone, so I had to opt for <em>akwolski</em> instead. Now you might say &ldquo;big deal, it&rsquo;s only on letter.&rdquo; But it irked me nonetheless. I own <a href=/>awolski.com</a>. My Twitter handle is <a href=https://twitter.com/awolski>awolski</a> (although I rarely tweet). I use <a href=https://bitbucket.org/awolski>awolski</a> on Bitbucket.</p><p>I <em>wanted</em> awolski on GitHub!</p><p>So when I saw recently that the username awolski on GitHub didn&rsquo;t appear to be being used, I researched what it would take to get it. A Google search for <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl#q=github%20username%20already%20taken">github username already taken</a> brought up a result linking to <a href=https://help.github.com/articles/name-squatting-policy>GitHub&rsquo;s name squatting policy</a>. Boom&mldr; just what I was looking for. I clicked on the <strong>Contact a human</strong> button and typed out my request.</p><blockquote><p>Hi,</p><p>I&rsquo;m enquiring about whether username awolski can be released? The user who has registered that username doesn&rsquo;t look to have any activity, and seeing as I own the domain (awolski.com), twitter handle et al. and will be starting a business using that name.</p><p>Would just like to know whether this would be possible.</p><p>Regards,
Tony</p></blockquote><p>And I was so pleasantly surprised to get a response later that same night:</p><blockquote><p>Hi Anthony,</p><p>Sure! We happily release unused usernames into the wild. I&rsquo;ve reviewed this account, and deemed it dusty, so I&rsquo;ve made the username available to you. If you want to create an organization, the name will be available.</p><p>You can change your username by following the guide here: <a href=https://help.github.com/articles/changing-your-github-username>https://help.github.com/articles/changing-your-github-username</a></p><p>Be aware, after you change your name, you will need to update the remotes in any local clones of your repositories to point at your new repository URL.</p><p>Also, grab the name quick, as it&rsquo;s now publicly available to anyone.</p><p>Cheers,
Chris</p></blockquote><p>Fabulous customer service.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awolski.com/parallel-deployment-in-tomcat/>Previous</a>
