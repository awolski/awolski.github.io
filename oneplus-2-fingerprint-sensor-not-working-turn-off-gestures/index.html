Turn off gestures</h1><small>2016-02-05</small></header><p>My OnePlus 2 fingerprint sensor stopped working about a month ago. I thought it must have been a delayed result of my 1 year old boy hurling it into the bath and it being submerged on the bottom for a good 5 seconds. But my wife was quick to react and rushed it to intensive care (a bowl full of rice), and after a couple of days — and to my surprise — the phone worked perfectly.</p><p>For the next week or so was convinced it would start to fail. And I was right; probably about 3 weeks post bath incident the fingerprint sensor died. I was disappointed, but with the backup of on-screen buttons it wasn&rsquo;t the end of the world; it was still usable.</p><p>Tonight I looked into seeing if it could be fixed. The third hit on Google for my search for &ldquo;oneplus 2 fingerprint sensor not working&rdquo; came up with <a href=https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/272489/Home+Button-Fingerprint+scanner+not+working+at+all>this</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I had the same problem. Try disabling gestures. It seems to alleviate the peoblem. Would still take the phone to the service centre to get it checked though</p></blockquote><p>My first thought? Not. A. Chance.</p><p>But I was willing to try anything, especially if it didn&rsquo;t involve the hassle of flashing, rooting, or reinstalling.</p><p>So I gave it a go&mldr; Gestures off. Turn off. Turn on.</p><p>And who would have guessed&mldr; it worked. And better yet, after turning gestures back on and the fingerprint sensor still works!</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awol.ski/problem-installing-jq-on-os-x-using-homebrew/>Previous</a>
