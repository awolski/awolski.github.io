Each day I exercise I put an X in my Bullet Journal monthly spread. If I miss a day I get a big blank spot and a broken chain. The idea is that motivation comes from not wanting to break the streak of Xs you&rsquo;ve built up. Seinfeld used the method to ensure he was writing jokes every day. My experiment is working well; I&rsquo;ve exercised on 53 of a possible 59 days to date. However there is always room for improvement, 6 out of 59 days worth of improvement.</p><p>The motivation I get from wanting to keep my streak alive is significant. On a number of occasions I&rsquo;ve been ready to get into bed before remembering I hadn&rsquo;t exercised that day, so I&rsquo;ve busted out a few sets of max push-ups beside the bed in my pyjamas, just to keep the streak alive. But I&rsquo;ve learned that I can&rsquo;t always rely on <em>Don&rsquo;t break the chain</em> motivation, or my memory, to get me over the line. Enter <strong><em>habit stacking</em></strong> and <strong><em>temptation bundling</em></strong>, two techniques I learned recently from a book called Atomic Habits (see my book notes <a href=books/atomic-habits>here</a>).</p><h2 id=habit-stacking--temptation-bundling>Habit stacking + temptation bundling</h2><p>The habit stacking technique is outlined in Atomic Habits in the section called <em>1st Law of Behaviour Change: Make it Obvious</em>&mldr;</p><blockquote><p>One of the best ways to to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behaviour on top.</p></blockquote><p>The <strong><em>habit stacking</em></strong> formula is:</p><blockquote><p>After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].</p></blockquote><p>Temptation bundling is described in <em>2nd Law of Behaviour Change: Make it Attractive</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do.</p></blockquote><p>Habit stacking and temptation bundling combine to form a powerful formula for behaviour change. The <strong><em>habit stacking + temptation bundling</em></strong> formula is:</p><blockquote><ol><li>After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].</li><li>After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].</li></ol></blockquote><p>So the idea is that you choose a habit that is already engrained and stack a habit you <em>need</em> (but is not yet a habit) on top. To make the habit you <em>need</em> more attractive, you add a habit you really <em>want</em> on the end. When you&rsquo;ve completed the habit you <em>need</em> you&rsquo;re free to enjoy the habit you <em>want</em>.</p><h2 id=my-implementation>My implementation</h2><p>My goal was to eliminate days where I was forgetting to exercise until the last minute. I decided my morning coffee was the ideal current habit to latch onto. I love my morning coffee, the smell of the grounds as I spoon them into the Bialetti coffee maker I set out the night before. The process has become a daily ritual, and is therefore a perfect candidate to build upon.</p><p>Using the <em>habit stacking + temptation bundling</em> formula I created this implementation intention:</p><ol><li>After I prepare my morning coffee but before I switch it on, I will do at least one set of exercise (push-ups, pull-ups, pistol squats or yoga).</li><li>After at least one set of exercise, I will finish making my coffee and sit down to enjoy it.</li></ol><p>It&rsquo;s early days — I&rsquo;ve only completed 9 days of this routine thus far — but it is working so well that I can&rsquo;t see myself stumbling. I&rsquo;m unlikely to forget making my morning coffee because it&rsquo;s typically the first thing I do in the morning (obvious). Sitting down to enjoy it is something I really enjoy (attractive). By sandwiching a habit I need (daily exercise) between the two I dramatically increase the likelihood my streak of Xs remains unbroken.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awolski.com/bujo/>Previous</a>
