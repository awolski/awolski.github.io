Awesome sauce.</p><p>The <a href=http://www.devoxx.co.uk/>Devoxx UK conference</a> was a couple of months ago so I&rsquo;d forgotten all about it (no, sadly I didn&rsquo;t go), but it was great to be made aware of the valuable resources. I get two very contrasting feelings when browsing libraries of conference talks like this. The first is over excitement at all the great content and new things that I&rsquo;m going to learn by watching them all. This is always and immediately followed by the thought:</p><blockquote><p>How the f*%$ am I going to find time to consume all of this?!</p></blockquote><p>I never manage to find time to watch everything I really want to, but I give it a good crack.</p><p>One talk which caught my eye immediately was Roberto Cortez&rsquo;s <strong>Five Ways to Not Suck at Being a Java Freelancer</strong> (video below). Having recently taken a leap of faith from a safe, permanent job into the unknown of freelancing/consulting, I found his talk really relevant, and full of great advice for those wanting to follow the same path.<br></p><p><div data-parleys-presentation=five-ways-suck-being-java-freelancer style=width:100%;height:300px><script type=text/javascript src=//parleys.com/js/parleys-share.js></script><a href=https://www.parleys.com/play/five-ways-suck-being-java-freelancer>Watch on Parleys.com</a></div></p><br>A lot of Cortez's advice I've already managed to figure out, but in such a short talk (16:03) there's some valuable tips to take on board, especially for those just starting out in the freelance/consultancy game.<p>I <em>particularly</em> liked Roberto&rsquo;s final message, which echoes the same thoughts that I had when I decided to take the plunge&mldr; What is the worst thing that can happen.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are very lucky at the work that we have. When I was younger I was never had the idea I was going to follow the tech world. And now, sometimes I have discussions with a couple of friends that we were very lucky because we actually followed a profession that we don&rsquo;t have a shortage of jobs. Actually there&rsquo;s more demand than supply, so what&rsquo;s the worst thing that can happen to you if you quit your job and start working as a freelancer. Probably in a couple of months if it doesn&rsquo;t work, you can join another corporate and start working again. So I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s going to be a problem for you to get a job again if freelance work doesn&rsquo;t work&mldr; So that&rsquo;s why I usually say, what&rsquo;s the worst thing that can happen to you.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Bang on Roberto.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awolski.com/aws-access-control-policies-and-iam-best-practices/>Previous</a>
