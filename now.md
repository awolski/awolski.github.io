Right now I'm trying to automate as much as possible, working as a DevOps engineer at a small but proud bank in Wales. I also try and find the time to continuously improve a conveyancing a quote system I wrote for a law firm here in Wales back in 2012.

I'm in training for my first 70.3 in September.

I'm also taking a year off alcohol. I started on 4th January 2018. So far I'd have to say my life is significantly better without alcohol than with it. 

And as always, I try and read, and think, as much as possible.
