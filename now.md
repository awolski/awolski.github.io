I'm currently on sabbatical. 

Ten years ago I watched a [TED talk about the power of time off](https://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_time_off). It made a lot of sense, and I decided I wanted a sabbatical when I turned 40. I turned 40 on May 31st 2019, so here I am.

I'm reading lots. Spending slow, unrushed time with my kids. I'm enjoying working on ~~chores~~ projects you never have time for when you're working 40 hours a week. I have lots of ideas about what I want to do, but for now I'm content in clearing the decks, slowly and thoughtfully.

I'm also strategising, on how to do this on a regular basis. The speaker in that talk was so right.
