I&rsquo;ve been welcomed warmly and have already found a couple of projects to help out with.</p><p>The climate-action.tech slack channels offer a steady stream of great resources and discussion. A few things I discovered today: <a href=https://sustainablewebdesign.org/>sustainable web design</a>, <a href=https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/>sustainable web manifesto</a>, <a href=https://www.websitecarbon.com>website carbon calculator</a> and <a href=https://www.ecograder.com>eco grader</a>.</p><p>I was particularly interested in testing out the <strong>website carbon calculator</strong>. The tool calculates &mdash; using a <a href=https://www.websitecarbon.com/how-does-it-work/>formula</a> which factors in data transfer over the wire, energy intensity of web data, energy source used by the data centre, and carbon intensity of the electricity &mdash; a website&rsquo;s carbon usage.</p><p>Naturally I entered this site, and was pleased to find that it is in the top 95% of web pages tested thus far, using only 0.04g of CO2 for each page load. Yay for me.</p><p>The site has a <a href=https://www.websitecarbon.com/badge/>website carbon badge</a> you can embed on your site to publicise its results&mldr;</p><div id=wcb class="carbonbadge wcb-d" style=margin-top:40px></div><script src=https://unpkg.com/website-carbon-badges@1.1.1/b.min.js defer></script><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awol.ski/compare/>Previous</a></footer><br><p><strong>Your thoughts?</strong> I'd love to hear them.
