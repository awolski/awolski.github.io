As a long time hater disliker of Agile and Scrum, Shape Up is a breath of fresh air, and in my opinion offers a realistic alternative to the industry standard way of working. It&amp;rsquo;s a great read and provides a detailed a look at how Basecamp work.
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to like about the book, and the process, so I thought I would pull out a few of the bits I appreciate and share them here.</description></item><item><title>Ten percent</title><link>https://awolski.com/10pc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 05:39:33 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/10pc/</guid><description>Each month I give 10% of my earnings (income not profit) to causes that benefit others and improve our long-term future.
I select charities recommended by organisations such as Effective Altruism and Give Well to maximise my donations and turn them into real action.

It has also demonstrated how advantageous it is, and how easy it can be, to live simply and to be content with the basics. So much can be taken away so quickly, as we have all experienced in recent times, and the more changes we have to adapt to, the more difficult it is to do so.</description></item><item><title>TEDx Cardiff 2020</title><link>https://awolski.com/tedx-cardiff-2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 11:46:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/tedx-cardiff-2020/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was fortunate enough to be invited to &lt;a href="https://tedxcardiff.co.uk/">TEDx Cardiff 2020&lt;/a> on the weekend. I had never been to a TED event before, but having seen my fair share of TED talks (some of which have changed my life) I jumped at the chance to see one live.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The MCs for the day, &lt;a href="http://richardastrudwick.com/">Richard Strudwick&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://neilmonteiro.com">Neil Monteiro&lt;/a>, were engaging, knowledgeable and funny. They were a likable pairÂ and had great chemistry, clearly built on the foundation of a good friendship. They bounced off each other in a way that reminded me of Australian radio and television comedic pair &lt;a href="https://www.hamishandandy.com/">Hamish and Andy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>February 2020 Reflection</title><link>https://awolski.com/february-2020-reflection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/february-2020-reflection/</guid><description>&lt;p>Each month I go back over the notes in my bullet journal and pull out anything of significance: notes, quotes, patterns, lessons, achievements, things that have gone well and those that haven&amp;rsquo;t.

Avoid frequent flyer programs. Avoid any type of loyalty scheme, store cards or points systems. Why? Because they lock you in and take away your ability to choose the best option in the current situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An example. This morning I had a couple of hours to burn before I met with a friend. It was a beautiful day, the sun was out and my walk into town was an absolute joy. My plan was to while away the time reading a book, and I really wanted to do so in a coffee shop where the sun was blazing in. Instead I chose to go to a coffee shop where I had accumulated enough stamps on their loyalty card to get a free coffee. It was a nice, and I enjoyed my coffee, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t where I &lt;em>really&lt;/em> wanted to be. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the warmth of the sun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My ability to choose the best option in the moment was affected by my loyalty to a particular chain, and the lure of a free coffee. Of course, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a free coffee. I had to buy nine before that to qualify for it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fresh starts</title><link>https://awolski.com/fs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/fs/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love fresh starts. Blank pages, new notebooks. The start of a new football season. The start of a new week, month&amp;hellip; a new year. Fresh starts mean opportunity and possibility, optimism and clarity. They give you the chance to try something new, or go again with renewed vigour, taking with you the lessons you learned previously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fresh starts give you energy. Which is why you should build more of them into your, more often.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used to love getting new notebooks at the start of a new school year. Each one gave me the chance to get things just right. Neat writing, straight lines, maybe even a new handwriting style. All the mistakes I made in previous notebooks were history. My mind would be full ideals and positivity about how well I would to do in the year ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I was always most motivated at the start of a football season. As difficult as preseasons were, finals aside, those were some of the most enjoyable months of the football year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Starting afresh gives us hope and opens us up to the possibilities of &lt;em>what could be&lt;/em>. It lets you reflect on the mistakes you made in the past, and allows you to design solutions so you don&amp;rsquo;t make the same mistakes again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Monzo webhooks to Google spreadsheets</title><link>https://awolski.com/monzo-to-gsheets/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/monzo-to-gsheets/</guid><description>&lt;p>For years I&amp;rsquo;ve used Google spreadsheets to track my finances. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried using services like &lt;a href="https://www.moneydashboard.com/">Money Dashboard&lt;/a> in the past, but although they are simple to use, there is always a feature I want that is missing. I prefer to have control of my data so I can add functionality as and when I need it. So despite the setup and maintenance overhead, a spreadsheet is still the way to go in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used to export bank and credit card transactions in csv format and import them manually. Doing so was a laborious and time consuming task which I hated, but writing scripts to automate it seemed like overkill, especially when authentication to Google and numerous banks was involved. Not to mention differences in export format between banks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon after I consolidated my accounts to &lt;a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo&lt;/a> I realised they had an API, including webhooks. &lt;em>Transaction webhooks!&lt;/em> I pondered how easy it would be to push my transaction data to Google spreadsheets in &lt;em>real time&lt;/em>, eliminating the manual and time consuming process of exporting/importing them myself. I thought if transactions fed directly into my sheet automatically, all I would need to do is categorise them. Simple. I knew it was possible to create web applications GSheets with &lt;a href="">Apps Script&lt;/a>, so all the ingredients were there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After reading some documentation and hacking about for an hour or so I&amp;rsquo;d proven it was entirely possible. Now, when a transaction occurs in my Monzo account it appears in the finance spreadsheet within milliseconds. This post explains how I got it working.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DevOps</title><link>https://awolski.com/devops/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/devops/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a &amp;lsquo;DevOps&amp;rsquo; engineer I often get asked &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;What is DevOps?&amp;quot;&lt;/em> Honestly, I struggle to answer. I usually come out with some spiel about automation and automating myself out of job. Which of course is next to impossible, which is why I don&amp;rsquo;t mind saying it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But really, what is DevOps?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DevOps is a term that rose from the car crash that was Development and Operations working in silos. Colleagues batting for the same team, working towards the same goals, but at the same time, enemies, convinced of, and cursing, each other&amp;rsquo;s incompetence.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>January 2020 Reflection</title><link>https://awolski.com/january-2020-reflection/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/january-2020-reflection/</guid><description>&lt;p>Each month I go back over the notes in my bullet journal and pull out anything of significance: notes, quotes, patterns, lessons, achievements, things that have gone well and those that haven&amp;rsquo;t.

Even in the middle of a cold UK winter, my days are so much better when I start them with an icy cold shower.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me rephrase that. I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>love&lt;/em> cold showers. The moment before entry is not one of eagerness, and the moment after entry not one of pleasure. What I love about them is how they make me feel, both during, and in particular, after the shower. I can wake up feeling a bit off, or even downright pessimistic, but after a short breath work session and a cold shower I feel totally re-energised and ready to take on the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was introduced to breathe work and cold water therapy by a &lt;a href="https://control-alt-delete.net">friend of mine&lt;/a> when wild camping in the French Alps. On the way down the mountain he took me through a guided breath work session followed by cold water immersion. I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt water so cold in all my life, and although I didn&amp;rsquo;t last more than thirty seconds in the water, the pain in my hands, feet and forearms was so intense I never thought I would do it again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But at a breath workshop in London a few months later, which involved being immersed in an ice bath for two minutes, I realised I could control my experience of, and my reaction to, the icy cold water. I also felt amazing afterwards. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a cold shower morning routine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2019 Reflections</title><link>https://awolski.com/2019-reflections/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/2019-reflections/</guid><description>&lt;p>I started to do a 2019 reflection post and quickly realised it was blowing out to a huge post, so I decided to break it down into smaller bite size chunks, which I&amp;rsquo;ll add in the coming week.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2019 Reflections - Health</title><link>https://awolski.com/2019-reflections-health/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/2019-reflections-health/</guid><description>&lt;p>Having completed a &lt;a href="https://awolski.com/nice-70_3">70.3&lt;/a> in 2018, I started the year assuming I would do another big fitness challenge. Initially I landed on a marathon, but in the first few days of the year I ruled it out. Training for the 70.3, although enjoyable and addictive, was time consuming, and I wanted to direct my attention to other endeavours in 2019. On the 4th January my bullet journal reads:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Decision made. Marathon out. Full time work is just too much when your focus this year is building a brand.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I decided to try a simpler approach to exercise: to do something, even if it was only small, every day. 50 push ups, 30 pull ups, 15 minutes of yoga. Just try to not break the chain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In total I hit 289 days of exercise from a possible 365, a strike rate of 79%. I&amp;rsquo;m usually really tough on myself, and I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed I didn&amp;rsquo;t reach a round number like 300 days, or 80-90%. But viewed from different perspective I averaged over 5 Â½ days per week, which is, in retrospect, a reasonable accomplishment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Irrespective of how many days I did, I hit the end of the year feeling fantastic. I felt strong &lt;em>enough&lt;/em>, fit &lt;em>enough&lt;/em> and flexible &lt;em>enough&lt;/em>. My focus was on the process and not the end result. I stopped comparing myself with others, how fast I could run compared to X, how much I could lift compared to Y, what I was doing or what I looked like compared to Z. It became all about putting an X down each day. The result? A much happier me, both physically and mentally.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Artificial environments of scarcity</title><link>https://awolski.com/artificial-environments-of-scarcity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/artificial-environments-of-scarcity/</guid><description>&lt;p>In their book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Millionaire-Next-Thomas-Stanley-Ph-D/dp/0671015206">&lt;em>The Millionaire Next Door&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, authors Thomas Stanley and William Danko discuss how millionaires who don&amp;rsquo;t budget become millionaires. These millionaires become wealthy because &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;They create an &lt;strong>artificial economic environment of scarcity&lt;/strong> for themselves and the other members of the household.&amp;quot;&lt;/em> In other words, they only make available to spend, by themselves and the members of their family, a proportion of the total amount of money earned. The rest is invested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/">Cal Newport&lt;/a> is a father of three, a professor and successful author who produces peer reviewed articles and books, amongst other work, at a prodigious rate. He also doesn&amp;rsquo;t work after 5:30pm, which seems an impossible feat given how much he creates. In his book &lt;a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Deep Work&lt;/a> Newport outlines what he terms &lt;em>fixed-schedule productivity&lt;/em>, in which &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;I fix the firm goal of not working past a certain time, then work backwards to find productivity strategies that allow me to satisfy this declaration.&amp;quot;&lt;/em> It seems counterintuitive, but by limiting the time available for work he is able to focus and produce more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://minimalismfilm.com/">Minimalism&lt;/a> â &lt;em>A Documentary About the Important Stuff&lt;/em>, we see the growing trend of people downsizing to tiny houses. The motivation for living in smaller houses, smaller spaces, seems to be one of affordability, simplicity and sustainability. But regardless of the intent, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that people choosing to live in tiny houses are &lt;em>limiting&lt;/em> the space available in which to live and store their belongings. This in turn makes &amp;lsquo;space&amp;rsquo; available in other areas of their lives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Slow down</title><link>https://awolski.com/slow-down/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/slow-down/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some days you wake up with a heavy feeling hanging over you. Ahead of you lies another day of grind. The mountain of things to do seems to only get bigger, the peak further away. On days like this you tend to view your role as &lt;strong>&lt;em>getting through&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> the day rather than &lt;strong>&lt;em>being in it&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is how I felt earlier this week. I lay in bed with that heavy, despondent feeling, another day of churn ahead of me, knowing I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be satisfied regardless of how much I achieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But instead of &lt;em>sucking it up and getting on with it&lt;/em> I decided to come downstairs slowly, make a cup of coffee, and just sit on the couch quietly. After some time I took out my journal and did my morning reflection &lt;em>slowly&lt;/em>, taking care with each letter, each word I wrote. I contemplated what each task meant instead of the usual quick glance. I savoured each sip of coffee. Then I started working on my first task, not trying to &lt;em>just get through it&lt;/em>, but to do a good, thoughtful job. Strangely I started to feel better. Happy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Let go</title><link>https://awolski.com/let-go/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/let-go/</guid><description>&lt;p>Everything you own feels like it is necessary. The services you subscribe to seem essential. Everything on your to-do list seems important. But when you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re forever chasing your tail and there&amp;rsquo;s never enough time in the day, eventually something has to go. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to decide what to cull, but after the initial withdrawal you wonder how you ever found time in the first place. It turns out very little is essential, it&amp;rsquo;s just hard to let things go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guidelines for less distracting email</title><link>https://awolski.com/guidelines-for-less-distracting-email/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/guidelines-for-less-distracting-email/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently started checking email only once per week. Last week I spent a mere twenty-eight minutes in my inbox. The difference between this new routine and the old, distracted, daily one is massive, and has made a significant impact on my ability to get big, important things done. However Derek Sivers&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href="https://sivers.org/pe">recent post&lt;/a> on using a private email address for close friends made me question whether checking email so infrequently would have the detrimental effect of removing a source of connection with my family and friends. I wondered whether I should consider a similar approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some though my answer is a resounding no; my way is just fine. Firstly, I hate duplication, and fanatically try to reduce the number of accounts I manage. In my opinion there are better ways to filter the signal from the noise than by opening a separate email account. Second, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to check email often or be distracted by notifications. Friends and family can reach me by phone when necessary, emergency or otherwise. A delay of a few days for more thoughtful correspondence shouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter for everything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that said, there are a couple of guidelines you can follow to extract as much value from email as possible while removing its ability to &lt;em>take valuable time and attention from you&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Monthly reflection - September 2019</title><link>https://awolski.com/monthly-reflection-september-2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/monthly-reflection-september-2019/</guid><description>&lt;p>Each month I look back over the month&amp;rsquo;s entries in my Bullet Journal to extract the things I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved, things that are going well or not so well, patterns that are emerging, and any lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. The process takes a long time, usually in the order of 3-4 hours, but I find the value I derive from it is well worth the effort. This month I want to experiment a little by publishing some of my notes, firstly to reinforce the lessons I learn, but also because, who knows, maybe someone else will find it valuable too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don't put up a zero</title><link>https://awolski.com/dont-put-up-a-zero/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/dont-put-up-a-zero/</guid><description>&lt;p>At the start of September I set myself a target of publishing two blog posts per week, on Tuesday and Friday. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter what they were, I just had to ship something. The intention, I kept reminding myself, is to build the habit of writing, and not to worry about the quality of what I&amp;rsquo;m putting out. If I kept at it, by the end of September I&amp;rsquo;d have eight posts under my belt. By the end of the year, thirty-six. In ten years time, if I maintain the same schedule, I will have published over a thousand posts, and by then I will have improved and, in the process, learned a thing or two about writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been anything but easy. Tuesdays and Fridays have been tough slogs, consisting of long hours spent writing and rewriting, and then rewriting some more. I find it an arduous task to put into words what I&amp;rsquo;m finding interesting and learning, all the while trying to block out the fear of &lt;em>what people will think&lt;/em>. I have to keep telling myself I&amp;rsquo;m writing for me, not for anyone else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then life goes and gets in the way. You&amp;rsquo;ve got this thing that you&amp;rsquo;re committed to but along comes a day when the weight of the world is on your shoulders, the universe urging you to lay down and give up. A headache. A sickness. An argument with your partner. Whatever. The last thing you want to do is &lt;strong>&lt;em>get to work&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>. This is how I feel today. It&amp;rsquo;s Friday and I have to ship, but the last thing I feel like doing is sitting down to write.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Year without alcohol</title><link>https://awolski.com/year-without-alcohol/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/year-without-alcohol/</guid><description>&lt;p>A good friend of mine, &lt;a href="http://control-alt-delete.net">Damian Fisher&lt;/a>, recently decided to give up alcohol for a year. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited for him, I get a little buzz when people decide to make big positive changes in their lives. I have little doubt removing booze from his life will result in huge benefits. Why so sure? Because I recently took a year off booze myself, and in doing so transformed my relationship with alcohol, improving my life immeasurably. It has been nine months since I finished my year, and with Damo just starting his, I thought it an opportune time to write about my experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reflection</title><link>https://awolski.com/reflection/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/reflection/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every morning and every evening, at the end of each week, and at the end of the month, I sit down with my &lt;a href="bujo">Bullet Journal&lt;/a> and go through my reflection routine. I look at the day, week or month and ask myself questions â and write down my answers to â like: &lt;em>What went well? What didn&amp;rsquo;t go so well? What did I learn? What patterns are emerging? What did I achieve? How can I improve?&lt;/em> The process helps me keep on top of the busyness of life, remain focussed on what&amp;rsquo;s important, review my progress and acknowledge my achievements. It&amp;rsquo;s also creating a wonderful resource for me to look back on, both now and later in life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed after reviewing my reflection entries is how habitual a creature I am. I repeat the same behaviour â the same mistakes â over and over again. Even after acknowledging a mistake or a habit one month, and defining an approach to rectify it in the next month, I&amp;rsquo;ll repeat the mistake and journal about it, completely oblivious of the original entry months prior.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s an example&amp;hellip; In my January &lt;strong>Lessons Learned&lt;/strong> I wrote &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Being honest is better than bottling things up&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> â probably in the context of how I handled a disagreement or annoyance with my wife. This last week (September) in my weekly reflection I wrote: &lt;em>&amp;quot;&lt;strong>Learned&lt;/strong>: Spoke calmly, open and honestly to Em about [an issue]. Has been good since then.&amp;quot;&lt;/em> Nearly nine months between the two instances and I&amp;rsquo;m still reverting to default behaviour when I&amp;rsquo;m frustrated, which is to remain quiet, bottle it up and give her the cold shoulder for a day or two.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Generalisation, specialisation and financial independence</title><link>https://awolski.com/generalisation-specialisation-financial-independence/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/generalisation-specialisation-financial-independence/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about financial independence a lot lately.

One of the better books I&amp;rsquo;ve read on the subject of FI is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Early-Retirement-Extreme-Philosophical-Independence/dp/145360121X/">&lt;em>Early Retirement Extreme&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s a gold mine of strategies, tactics and principles to help you achieve FI, and personally, forced me to re-think my place in the world and how I want to spend my time in it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An important ideal brought up in ERE is that of the Renaissance man; one who strives to develop his abilities to their full extent in many areas of life. A Renaissance man, Fisker explains, obtains knowledge in a wide range of subjects and excels at many different things. He is a polymath, a jack-of-all-trades. &lt;strong>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;The Renaissance man is capable of many different things and doesn&amp;rsquo;t restrict himself to vocational skills. He does his own taxes and researches his own investments. He can fix a computer or a broken appliance. He knows how to drive and fix a car, but he has enough time and athletic ability to ride his bicycle 20 miles instead, or run five miles to get groceries. He can play an instrument, dance, paint, or write creatively. He can recreate interesting meals from scratch rather than recipe.&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> One of the many advantages of becoming a Renaissance man, Fisker explains, is that you become less reliant on outsourcing your life and operations, which keeps you in paid employment (a Salary man).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In other words, to achieve financial independence it is desirable to be a &lt;strong>generalist&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Habit tracking</title><link>https://awolski.com/habit-tracking/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/habit-tracking/</guid><description>&lt;p>Habit tracking has become a huge win for me this year. The knowledge I&amp;rsquo;ve gained reading Atomic Habits combined with my Bullet Journal habit tracker have helped me cultivate good habits and eliminate bad habits that I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with for years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I keep it simple and commit to a maximum of five habits each month, but rarely more than four. I find I lose focus and get overwhelmed if I try to do too much. I use the columns in my Bullet Journal&amp;rsquo;s monthly collection, one column for each habit I&amp;rsquo;m tracking.&lt;/p>

The post is full of great advice to help reduce your phone use and well worth a read. Holiday is spot on â our phones have become an instant escape, and a constant burden. We find it easier to whip them out in moments of idleness than be alone with our thoughts. We feel compelled to find out what the latest ping was irrespective of what we&amp;rsquo;re doing in the moment. This behaviour becomes compulsive. We reach for our phones without thinking, reinforcing those neural pathways that keep us from being fully present with our friends, family, children&amp;hellip; our lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What struck me most about the post was how evolved my own phone reduction habits have become. I have already implemented most of what Holiday suggests, and in some instances pushed the boundaries even further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this in mind I thought I would follow up with my own strategies to reduce the time I spend on my phone. Some of these overlap with Ryan Holiday&amp;rsquo;s strategies, some have spawned from Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s blog and book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Digital-Minimalism-Living-Better-Technology/dp/0241341132/">Digital Minimalism&lt;/a>, while others I&amp;rsquo;ve devised on my own by simply becoming more aware of my behaviour. I have much healthier, productive relationship with my phone as a result.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gaining wisdom and saving Â£50,000</title><link>https://awolski.com/gaining-wisdom-and-saving-50k/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/gaining-wisdom-and-saving-50k/</guid><description>&lt;p>This post started out with the title &lt;em>How a Book Saved Me Â£50,000&lt;/em>. Part way through writing it, however, I realised it was a specific example of a more general, more valuable concept: how we can improve ourselves and our lives by applying the knowledge â the wisdom â that others have worked hard to acquire.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Employ your time in improving yourself by other men&amp;rsquo;s writings, so that you should gain easily what others have laboured hard for. â Socrates&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I wish I&amp;rsquo;d read &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Early-Retirement-Extreme-Philosophical-Independence/dp/145360121X/">Early Retirement Extreme&lt;/a> (ERE) 9 years ago when I first added it to my reading list. Had I done so I might well be financially independent already. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I read it when I did, though, because in doing so I avoided ploughing myself into another Â£50,000 of debt, and years of work required to pay it off. It was a close call though. I had my finger on the button. I was hours away from picking up the phone, firstly to try and negotiate the quote we&amp;rsquo;d been given, but ultimately to give the go ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As fate would have it I had also started reading ERE in the days prior. On page 4 I underlined a sentence, &lt;em>&amp;quot;&amp;hellip;with tens of thousands being spent on marginal increases in functionality.&amp;quot;&lt;/em> The note was marked with an asterix, and at the bottom of the page I wrote some &lt;a href="https://ryanholiday.net/marginalia-the-anti-library-and-other-ways-to-master-the-lost-art-of-reading/">marginalia&lt;/a>: &lt;strong>Currently pondering a Â£50,000 extension and garage conversion&lt;/strong>. In the days and pages that followed my outlook was completely transformed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://awolski.com/assets/img/2019-09-03-typical-working-life.png" alt="Typical working life">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He then cuts 5 years from the retirement section and intersperses them throughout the working section.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The audience laughs and applauds; it seems they think the idea is as novel as I do. Such a simple idea, but for me, profound.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea stayed with me, and in the years that followed I dreamed of taking my first sabbatical. I was never sure it would be possible financially, or whether I would have the guts follow through, so for a long time it remained only a dream. But I continued to speak about the TED Talk with friends and family and in doing so fanned the flames of the dream. I worked hard, caught a few lucky breaks, and in my late thirties, when the possibility of a sabbatical somehow seemed more realistic, I tentatively began telling people about my &amp;lsquo;plans&amp;rsquo;. One friend commented &amp;ldquo;If it were anyone else I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe them, but I reckon you will.&amp;rdquo; I still wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Implementing Atomic Habits</title><link>https://awolski.com/atomic-habits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/atomic-habits/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Jerry Seinfeld&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Don&amp;rsquo;t Break the Chain&lt;/em> method to try and exercise every day. Each day I exercise I put an X in my Bullet Journal monthly spread. If I miss a day I get a big blank spot and a broken chain. The idea is that motivation comes from not wanting to break the streak of Xs you&amp;rsquo;ve built up. Seinfeld used the method to ensure he was writing jokes every day. My experiment is working well; I&amp;rsquo;ve exercised on 53 of a possible 59 days to date. However there is always room for improvement, 6 out of 59 days worth of improvement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The motivation I get from wanting to keep my streak alive is significant. On a number of occasions I&amp;rsquo;ve been ready to get into bed before remembering I hadn&amp;rsquo;t exercised that day, so I&amp;rsquo;ve busted out a few sets of max push-ups beside the bed in my pyjamas, just to keep the streak alive. But I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that I can&amp;rsquo;t always rely on &lt;em>Don&amp;rsquo;t break the chain&lt;/em> motivation, or my memory, to get me over the line. Enter &lt;strong>&lt;em>habit stacking&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>&lt;em>temptation bundling&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>, two techniques I learned recently from a book called Atomic Habits (see my book notes &lt;a href="books/atomic-habits">here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Bullet Journal Method</title><link>https://awolski.com/bujo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/bujo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Starting a Bullet Journal in 2019 has been the single most impactful thing I&amp;rsquo;ve done this year. It has transformed the way I organise my life and forced me to spend more time offline.

It is still early days, but I get the feeling my Bullet Journal is here to stay.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nice 70.3</title><link>https://awolski.com/nice-70_3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/nice-70_3/</guid><description>&lt;p>On 16th September 2018 I finished my first &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_70.3">Ironman 70.3&lt;/a>. It was a fantastic event and experience, one in which I felt all the highs and lows I anticipated in the lead up: nerves, excitement, frustration, desperation, relief.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A friend and I signed up for the 70.3 on the 6th February this year. We had been looking for a challenge to occupy our time and minds whilst undertaking a &lt;a href="https://awolski.com/show">year without alcohol&lt;/a>. I had previously trained for a 70.3 back in 2010 before kids were on the radar. When marriage and kids came along training fizzled out, but a seed had been planted and I always felt I would revisit it in the years to come. When my friend suggested Nice 70.3 all the other options we were considering went out the window. For me, the half Ironman was it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What will you have to show for it?</title><link>https://awolski.com/show/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/show/</guid><description>&lt;p>This question was put to me by a friend on a recent night out (pint of cider in his hand) about the purpose of my dry year, which I&amp;rsquo;m nearly half way through. My initial, unconvincing response was that, at the very least, I&amp;rsquo;ll have completed a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_70.3">70.3&lt;/a>, to which he again queried &amp;ldquo;You couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done that anyway?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His playful jibe, and my meek response, got me thinking more deeply about my decision. What do I really want out of this year? Could it be obtained with alcohol along for the ride?&lt;/p>

It feels like a significant birthday, like a milestone. As if tomorrow is my 40th, not my 39th. Maybe my mind is sending a strong message that I&amp;rsquo;ve only got one year left until the milestone really is here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I watched with interest as a number of my friends crossed the 40 mark over the last few years. Some of them did so without flinching. Others&amp;hellip; well, from the outside it looked as if they had a harder time. Mostly, for the ones who seemed to struggle the most, it appeared as though turning 40 was a bit of a wake-up call; a reminder that the clock is ticking and they&amp;rsquo;d better get a wriggle on with a few things. I started thinking about my own life as a result; how I would like to feel as I neared 40, and what would need to be done in the run-up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An imminent birthday is an ideal time to reflect on the year just gone, to savour what you have right now, and cast your eye out into the future. This post is intended for these purposes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reducing email</title><link>https://awolski.com/reducing-email/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/reducing-email/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is your life and it&amp;rsquo;s ending a minute at a time - Fight Club&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This quote from Fight Club is an idea I take seriously. It may sound morbid, but it helps me to cull the trivial and shallow from my life, creating more time to focus on what I truly value. Lately, email has been an annoying time thief.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am increasingly frustrated with the number of emails I have to process. The newsletters I never read, the feature updates for services I don&amp;rsquo;t use, new terms of service, feedback requests, payment confirmations etc. These messages are informational, unactionable, unnecessary. I don&amp;rsquo;t need or want to see them.

&lt;p>Every time you choose to do the easy thing, instead of the right thing, you are shaping your identity, becoming the type of person who does whatâs easy, rather than whatâs right. â Hal Elrond, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B013PKZUOW">The Miracle Morning&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I highlight a lot of passages and take a lot of notes as I read. Some passages I highlight are forgotten shortly after consumption. Others remain firmly lodged in my mind, and go on to influence my thoughts and actions for weeks, months and years. Occasionally something I read threatens to shape the person I am and who I become for the rest of my life. The above is one of the latter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How often do you let a single bad day ruin the rest of your week? You eat something shit, you miss a workout, or you fail to do something you promised yourself you would do. But instead of rectifying the failing today, you vow that you&amp;rsquo;ll get back on track next week. &amp;ldquo;Next week will be a good week. Next week I&amp;rsquo;ll smash it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

Take this excerpt from Anders Ericsson&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B019CH3M10">Peak&lt;/a> for example:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The general belief was that once a person reached adulthood, the wiring of his or her brain was pretty much fixed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We now know:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip; the brain&amp;rsquo;s structure and function are not fixed. They change in response to use. It is possible to shape the brain âÂ your brain, my brain, anybody&amp;rsquo;s brain â in ways that we desire through conscious, deliberate training.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Personally I find it incredibly encouraging to know that our brains possess this plasticity and we can be optimistic for the future, knowing that whatever we set our mind to we can achieve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An example of our brain&amp;rsquo;s plasticity presented in the book struck me as something that I&amp;rsquo;d experienced before&amp;hellip; improving my ability to read smaller text on my laptop&amp;rsquo;s screen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clear the obstacles for tomorrow's success</title><link>https://awolski.com/clear-the-obstacles-for-tomorrows-success/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/clear-the-obstacles-for-tomorrows-success/</guid><description>&lt;p>As I sit down to write this, the path has been cleared for me to simply wake up and get started on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">the vital few&lt;/a>; namely, the activities I&amp;rsquo;ve identified as contributors to my success and happiness.

&lt;p>âIf you wish to improve,â Epictetus once said, âbe content to appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters.â&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ahhhh&amp;hellip; that feels good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I came across this wise piece of advice whilst reading &lt;a href="http://observer.com/2016/11/want-to-really-make-america-great-again-stop-reading-the-news/">Want to Really Make America Great Again? Stop Reading the News&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="http://ryanholiday.net/">Ryan Holiday&lt;/a>. It feels good because I&amp;rsquo;m more often than not uninformed â unaware even â about extraneous matters like current events. Holiday goes on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of the most powerful things we can do as a human being in our hyperconnected, 24/7 media world is say: âI donât know.â Or, more provocatively: âI donât care.â&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Even better. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly comforting to know that smart men have adopted the same beliefs and behaviours you have.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m drawn to the whole concept of minimalism, tiny houses, efficient spaces, owning and consuming less. To having more time with which I choose to do what I want.

&lt;p>Today I encountered the same problem, in a different CaffÃ© Nero and on a stable version of Docker for Mac. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t be just a coincidence. A quick search brought me to &lt;a href="https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/3419">this&lt;/a> GitHub issue, and in particular this answer:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Hi guys&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>127.0.0.1 localunixsocket&lt;/code> to &lt;code>etc/hosts&lt;/code> solved the issue for me&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And sure enough, updating &lt;code>/etc/hosts&lt;/code> to include &lt;code>127.0.0.1 localunixsocket&lt;/code> fixed the issue immediately.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Failing aws cli on Docker container with old date time</title><link>https://awolski.com/failing-aws-cli-on-docker-container-with-old-date-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/failing-aws-cli-on-docker-container-with-old-date-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I hit an issue which completely stumped me (for a while).

&lt;p>For the next week or so was convinced it would start to fail. And I was right; probably about 3 weeks post bath incident the fingerprint sensor died. I was disappointed, but with the backup of on-screen buttons it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the end of the world; it was still usable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Problem installing jq on OS X using Homebrew</title><link>https://awolski.com/problem-installing-jq-on-os-x-using-homebrew/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/problem-installing-jq-on-os-x-using-homebrew/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is just a quick post for reference as I had issues installing &lt;a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq&lt;/a> on my machine this evening.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The things you discover... httpie and jq</title><link>https://awolski.com/the-things-you-discover-jq-and-httpie/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/the-things-you-discover-jq-and-httpie/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sometimes working with technology you feel so far behind the eight ball.

Not a good start to my writing year!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2015 is winding down. Em has taken the kids out to a park with a friend and her kids, leaving me with a couple of hours to myself. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d reflect on the year was, in writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing â particularly in the technical arena â was a key focus for me at the start of the year, based on a journal entry I wrote in January. Here&amp;rsquo;s a snippet from that entry:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Writing has the effect of forcing you to understand a topic, and it conveys that understanding to the rest of the (tech) world (or at least the ones that stumble across your blog).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My goal in 2015 is to completely leapfrog everyone at my company, become the no-questions-asked go-to guy at &lt;em>insert_company&lt;/em>, and develop a presence within the worldwide Java community&amp;hellip; even if it&amp;rsquo;s just a very small presence.&lt;/p>

I could count dozens of instances in recent yearsin which there have been serious disconnects in the teams and organisations I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for, in which information is not getting to all the relevant parties. Like the synapses of our collective brain were not connected all the required neurons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I read a great article, &lt;a href="http://ben.balter.com/2015/11/12/why-urls/">Why everything should have a URL&lt;/a> which made some great points about the deficiencies of email and today&amp;rsquo;s default workflow. The quote below is taken from the section &lt;a href="http://ben.balter.com/2015/11/12/why-urls/#todays-default-workflow">Today&amp;rsquo;s default workflow&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Most organizations today transact business almost entirely through email and in-person meetings. Absent an additional step whereby participants go out of their way to capture and share context, organization knowledge primarily lives in two places: in employeesâ heads, and in their inbox. If that employee leaves the organization, or if they win the lottery and donât show up on Monday (read: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor&lt;/a>), a significant amount of information â information essential to the organizationâs continued operation â leaves with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think through some common scenarios where a team member might need to gain additional context they werenât originally privy to: they could have been out of the office when a decision was made (humans do silly things like getting sick or making other, smaller humans), they could have been on a different team at the time, heck, maybe they werenât even part of the organization at the time. Whatever the reason, they became a stakeholder mid-decision or post-decision, and thus lack the context necessary to properly participate going forward, especially not on equal footing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How is that essential context shared? In many organizations I suspect the answer is âI guess you had to be there. I think Bob was there that day, you should go ask himâ. Assuming you can find Bobâs desk, heâs in the office that day, free at the moment, and remembers a meeting that potentially happened months or years earlier, you might be able to get your question answered, but that process doesnât scale as people constantly move around and new team members are onboarded. Bob could hunt through his inbox and forward a stream of emails for you to read through in reverse chronological order, but thatâs likely neither efficient nor very helpful for either party involved (âcan you forward me the attachment?â).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ain&amp;rsquo;t that the truth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review - Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life</title><link>https://awolski.com/book-review-minimalism-live-a-meaningful-life/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/book-review-minimalism-live-a-meaningful-life/</guid><description>&lt;p>I picked up this &lt;a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/lml/">book&lt;/a> the day after Christmas when both my wife and I were overwhelmed with the sheer quantity of gifts that we and this kids had been given for Christmas.

The rest of the day, in between playing with the kids with their new toys, was dedicated to a huge toy cull and reorganisation minimalisation.

How? I really struggled with this question for some time, but I&amp;rsquo;ve since discovered the solution. Read on to find out how&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My specific use case is this: start a local npm registry â &lt;a href="https://github.com/rlidwka/sinopia">sinopia&lt;/a> â that acts as a proxy with an uplink to another npm registry. Run &lt;code>npm install --registry http://localhost:4873/&lt;/code> for a bunch of node modules, which pulls the node modules into the storage directory of the sinopia proxy. Then package up the the proxy sinopia instance as a distributable registry with all dependencies in its &lt;code>storage&lt;/code> directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I first got started with Docker I tried this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-dockerfile" data-lang="dockerfile">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">RUN&lt;/span> sinopia --config /opt/sinopia/config.yaml&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">RUN&lt;/span> npm install --registry http://localhost:4873/ &amp;lt;package&amp;gt;&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>But I soon realised this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. In this example, by the time the second RUN command executes, sinopia is no longer running. That layer of &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/introduction/understanding-docker/#how-does-a-docker-image-work">Union File System&lt;/a> has already been committed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making Time Blocking Work with Google Calendar</title><link>https://awolski.com/making-time-blocking-work-with-google-calendar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/making-time-blocking-work-with-google-calendar/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s Study Hack&amp;rsquo;s blog, and have made several attempts at adopting a number of his practices, like &lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/08/drastically-reduce-stress-with-a-work-shutdown-ritual/">daily shutdown rituals&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2014/08/08/deep-habits-plan-your-week-in-advance/">weekly planning&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/">time blocking&lt;/a>.

I get two very contrasting feelings when browsing libraries of conference talks like this. The first is over excitement at all the great content and new things that I&amp;rsquo;m going to learn by watching them all. This is always and immediately followed by the thought:&lt;/p>

The SDK has a &lt;a href="https://docs.stormpath.com/java/apidocs/index.html?com/stormpath/sdk/client/Proxy.html">Proxy&lt;/a> class just for this purpose, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t conform to the &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/spec-136004.html">JavaBeans specification&lt;/a> (a good explanation of which can be found &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3295517/2309046">here&lt;/a>). The Proxy class has two constructors, both with arguments, and its fields are final. Because I&amp;rsquo;m using Apache Shiro and initialising the Stormpath client using a &lt;a href="https://shiro.apache.org/configuration.html">shiro.ini configuration file&lt;/a>, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see a way to set the Proxy on the ClientBuilder where it was needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether this design is intentional or not. Maybe the Proxy class was created without much thought about Shiro integration. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m missing something. But I can&amp;rsquo;t find any documentation about how to configure it without doing so in code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still needed a solution though&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I discovered Shiro&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://shiro.apache.org/static/1.2.3/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/jndi/JndiObjectFactory.html">JndiObjectFactory&lt;/a>, which allows you to look up objects in JNDI from your shiro.ini. Using the approach I&amp;rsquo;ll explain below, I was able to use my system&amp;rsquo;s already configured Java proxy settings - if they are configured - but not have to change any code if I continue develop the application in a non-proxy environment, like at home.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Docker to spin up databases for development</title><link>https://awolski.com/using-docker-to-spin-up-databases-for-development/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/using-docker-to-spin-up-databases-for-development/</guid><description>&lt;p>Using Docker to spin up production-like databases during application development can help take out the uncertainty of whether your changes will work when deployed to production.

&lt;p>Have you ever been developing something for a long period of time, making changes to your development database as you go, and then when you&amp;rsquo;ve gone to integrate it into staging or production things haven&amp;rsquo;t quite worked? You&amp;rsquo;ve had to manually write scripts to &amp;lsquo;fix&amp;rsquo; things, or try and get back to your clean development database state by exporting, copying and importing&amp;hellip; all manually via your database client?&lt;/p>

There just seems to be so much going on in life: family life, kids, work, trying to get a side business off the ground, maintaining some level of fitness by doing a WOD 4 to 5 times a week, let alone all the day to day things that need to get done. Even getting up at 5am, there&amp;rsquo;s only ever an hour or so at the end of the day before I go to bed at 10pm, during which I&amp;rsquo;m usually getting some coding or reading done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I got to thinking, how can I &amp;ldquo;hack&amp;rdquo; my way to achieve my goal of blog posting 5 times per week when time is so limited? Squeeze in an hour at work? Write before I go to bed? I was coming up short with viable options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then last Friday my new Oneplus One arrived. I played around with it for most of Friday night, and then off and on over the weekend. One thing that I discovered worked amazingly well that I&amp;rsquo;d never really used before is Google&amp;rsquo;s speech to text functionality. I was gob-smacked at how easy it was to use, and how accurate it was. I soon began to wonder whether it could be the answer to my non-blogging dilemma.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The day after I published my post, my old Crossfit box owner Pete Rankine echoed similar (and more elaborate) sentiments on &lt;a href="http://www.theboatshedfitness.co.uk/">The Boat Shed&lt;/a>&amp;lsquo;s WOD &lt;a href="http://www.theboatshedfitness.co.uk/2015/03/19/friday-20-03-2015/">blog&lt;/a>. Hearing Pete&amp;rsquo;s thoughts really reinforced my own goals, and my drive to continue the habit of waking early.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole post is definitely worth a read, but I particularly liked:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The number one excuse for not working out is the lack of time. After having a long day at work, going to the gym can easily become a small priority. Waking up before 6 am allows you to hit the gym before starting your workday.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

There have been periods during which I have woken early for a few weeks, possibly even a few months, but it&amp;rsquo;s never &amp;lsquo;stuck&amp;rsquo; like I would like it to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But recently I&amp;rsquo;ve made it happen. It was the jet lag after our 7 week in Australia that began the trend, starting with the 4am wake up my daughter gave me the day after we got back. But since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting up at or before 5:30am consistently. And I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s going to change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How? I think the main reason is that now that I&amp;rsquo;ve got young children, I place an extremely high premium on any spare time that I get to myself. To exercise, to think, and to get things done. And the only time there is available to do those things - not when you&amp;rsquo;re exhausted after a full day of work and kids - is early in the morning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting featured on stormpath.com</title><link>https://awolski.com/getting-featured-on-stormpath-com/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/getting-featured-on-stormpath-com/</guid><description>&lt;p>At the start of 2015 I set myself a goal to contribute more to the worldwide Java community.

It was a really well organised event with some great speakers, and Iâve got Moleskin full of notes and ideas to take back to the office and try and somehow integrate into our development/delivery processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the highlights for me was &lt;a href="http://blog.xebialabs.com/author/aphillips/">Andrew Phillips&lt;/a>â â VP of Products at XebiaLabs â talk on the Three Pillars of Continuous Delivery: Culture, Tooling &amp;amp; Practices. He made a valid point that itâs a reality that â10 kids with some financing and a bit of software can put you out of business.â And Itâs so true. Big enterprises that are slow to adopt these new trends, tools and practices which enable fast, robust software delivery â providing real value to customers when they need it â are at real risk of being left behind. This was a theme was echoed by other speakers throughout the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At one point he asked the audience âwho here [whoâs company] practices Agile?â Pretty much every hand in the room went up. He then stuck up a slide which read:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>âOur highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.â&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>and asked âWho practices this?â Not a lot of hand went up. But those who really know their agile would be aware that this is the &lt;a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">#1 Principle of the Agile Manifesto&lt;/a>. I was shocked. My company says that itâs Agile. Not according to the Agile manifesto weâre not.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Template SoapUI tests with XmlSlurper</title><link>https://awolski.com/template-soapui-tests-with-xmlslurper/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/template-soapui-tests-with-xmlslurper/</guid><description>&lt;p>In between urgent bug fixes and planned sprint work I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to find time to write an automated test suite with &lt;a href="http://www.soapui.org/">SoapUI&lt;/a> to verify some of the things we can&amp;rsquo;t in &lt;a href="https://awolski.com/unit-tests-worth-their-weight-in-gold/">unit tests&lt;/a>.

Because of this complexity, and the possibility of inadvertantly breaking existing functionality and/or business rules, I wanted to make &lt;em>damn sure&lt;/em> my changes were sound.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful machine, and so far it has been a joy to use. My first order of business was to setup an environment from which I can work from home, which means VMWare hosting Windows. I&amp;rsquo;ve dedicated 4GB RAM to it and it runs like a dream, and with three finger swipe and can switch between it and my other OS X workspaces in no time. And it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see even with Windows running in a virtual machine, I&amp;rsquo;ve still got 10GB+ of RAM left to play with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before I wipe my old laptop - an early 2008 black Macbook with 2.4Ghz Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD - I thought I&amp;rsquo;d run some benchmarks on the old machine and the new one to see how much more productive (cough) I&amp;rsquo;m going to be.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Request your GitHub username</title><link>https://awolski.com/request-your-github-username/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/request-your-github-username/</guid><description>&lt;p>Consistency is a good thing. It&amp;rsquo;s nice (though increasingly rare) to have the same username on all the sites you use on the web.

Parallel deployment allows you to deploy multiple versions of a web application with the same context path at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;ve got an awesome application running on Tomcat at the url &lt;code>http://yourdomain.com/awesomeapp&lt;/code>.

You&amp;rsquo;ve modified the &lt;code>path&lt;/code> element of your context.xml file so that your app is reachable at the aforementioned url. You realise you need to deploy a new version of your app because &lt;em>&amp;lt;insert your reason here&amp;gt;&lt;/em>, but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to bring down the whole application server and deploy the new version of the app.&lt;/p>

I was pleasantly surprised as I read through the list that I know and frequently use the majority of them:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Confluence&lt;/strong> - We use Confluence for &lt;del>all&lt;/del> most of the technical documentation at my company; in fact, I wrote an internal blog post a few days ago. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice, intuitive application, and really easy to use. It still feels like it&amp;rsquo;s got a lot of work to go into it - that it&amp;rsquo;s not as polished as JIRA - but the it&amp;rsquo;s by far the best online document management tool I&amp;rsquo;ve used.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Git&lt;/strong> - As a developer, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard about or used Git by now&amp;hellip; where the hell have you been? I use Git for my personal projects, and have been pushing to get it at the my company for quite a while now (we still use SVN - Linus Torvalds gives his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">opinion about SVN here&lt;/a>). I&amp;rsquo;m by no means a Git expert, but I&amp;rsquo;m learning more and more all the time. And I can without hesitation vouch for Git&amp;rsquo;s power.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Initially, I thought &lt;a href="http://www.liquibase.org/documentation/ant/changelogsync_ant_task.html">changelogsync&lt;/a> need to be executed against your database first, in order for the Liquibase tables to be created and have your database marked as in a &amp;lsquo;from now on we&amp;rsquo;re on Liquibase&amp;rsquo; state. And when I looked back over the &lt;a href="http://www.liquibase.org/documentation/existing_project.html">existing project documentation&lt;/a>, I thought they had messed up the section &amp;lsquo;We are going to use Liquibase starting&amp;hellip; NOW!':&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Instead of building up a changeLog to match your existing database, you can instead just declare âfrom now on we are using Liquibaseâ. The advantage to this is that it much easier to set up because it is just a mandate. Usually this works best going from one version to the next because your databases are all in a reasonably consistent state and you simply start tracking database changes in your next version using Liquibase. Because Liquibase only looks at the DatabaseChangeLog table to determine what needs to run, it doesnât care what else might be in your database and so it will leave all your existing tables alone and just run the new changeSets.&lt;/p>

But mainly because it&amp;rsquo;s free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There a a couple of gripes I have with Blogger:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It is just plain painful if you want to dig into the HTML and CSS to make any changes to the layout. Yes it is possible, but after several attempts over the years, with varying degrees of success, I just don&amp;rsquo;t understand why they&amp;rsquo;ve made it so difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The editor is hideous. I can never get my posts to display the way that I want. More often than not I have to switch to the HTML editor and painstakingly pull out the plethora of &lt;code>&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&lt;/code> and other elements placed &lt;em>everywhere&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I first read about the &lt;a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost Blogging Platform&lt;/a> while reading Jeff Atwood&amp;rsquo;s post &lt;a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/10-years-of-coding-horror/">10 Years of Coding Horror&lt;/a>. If someone with as much blogging clout as Jeff Atwood has made the switch, that&amp;rsquo;s endorsement enough for me. So I moseyed on over to the Ghost site to check it out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tonight, for the first time ever, I verified the MD5 checksum of a file I downloaded.

It was a really interesting presentation, and quite applicable to me at the moment because I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do decide an a new architecture and web framework for an application I&amp;rsquo;ve developed&amp;hellip; one that currently uses Primefaces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One slide in particular caught my attention, referencing a link to a ThoughtWorks note about JSF:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We continue to see teams run into trouble using JSF &amp;ndash; JavaServer Faces &amp;ndash; and are recommending you avoid this technology. Teams seem to choose JSF because it is a J2EE standard without really evaluating whether the programming model suits them. We think JSF is flawed because it tries to abstract away HTML, CSS and HTTP, exactly the reverse of what modern web frameworks do. JSF, like ASP.NET webforms, attempts to create statefulness on top of the stateless protocol HTTP and ends up causing a whole host of problems involving shared server-side state. We are aware of the improvements in JSF 2.0, but think the model is fundamentally broken. We recommend teams use simple frameworks and embrace and understand web technologies including HTTP, HTML and CSS.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/#/languages-and-frameworks/683">http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/#/languages-and-frameworks/683&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This does kind of sum up an underlying uncomfortable feeling I&amp;rsquo;ve had with JSF and the few frameworks I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with (MyFaces and PrimeFaces). Primefaces in particular is great if you want to get something done quickly with a whole load of out-of-the-box components. But I don&amp;rsquo;t like the &amp;lsquo;statefulness on a stateless protocol (HTTP).&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;m drawn to use HTTP as it was intended (a stateless protocol) and move toward a REST based back end which I can plug in (and experiment with) any front end web framework I choose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something else to keep in mind is what Rich Manalang calls the four principles of modern web development:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Designing for mobile first (even if you&amp;rsquo;re not building a mobile app)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Build only single page apps&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create and use your own REST API (I really like this one - a work in progress for me)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Sex sells&amp;rdquo; applies to web apps&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Installing Liquibase Extensions</title><link>https://awolski.com/installing-liquibase-extensions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awolski.com/installing-liquibase-extensions/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since version 3.1, support for &amp;lsquo;less common&amp;rsquo; databases has been removed from the core Liquibase distribution.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re not measuring things, you don&amp;rsquo;t care, and you don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I want to know exactly how much energy we are using so that I can make efficiency adjustments over time, and know exactly how each one performs. How are you supposed to know why your bills are so high, or how to reduce them if you need to, when you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you&amp;rsquo;re actually using?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My requirements for the monitoring tool were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Something quick and easy to set up that allowed me to quickly enter meter readings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A calculation of daily consumption/production based on the day&amp;rsquo;s readings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a reading was missed (i.e. we go away on holiday), daily consumption calculation to be averaged out over how many days readings were missed, not spiked on the one day the reading is done&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Calculation of the financial expense and income generated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pretty charts to visualise the data
Google Spreadsheets/Forms covered most of my requirements, and Apps Script gives me the flexibility and power to customise where Spreadsheets falls short.&lt;/li>
