It has been in production use ever since.</p><p>The system allows the firm to rapidly take details of clients who are purchasing or selling a property, and automatically calculates fees such as stamp duty and land taxes. Quotes are calculated on the fly so agents can give clients accurate, real-time view of what the purchase or sale will cost.</p><p>The process was paper-based, manual and error prone before the system was introduced. With more than 500 quotes per month, the system has saved the firm significant time and cost, and provided valuable business intelligence.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/cqs.png alt="Conveyancing Quote System screenshot"></p><h2 id=features>Features</h2><ul><li>Quotes creation, retrieval, updates and search</li><li>PDF document generation</li><li>Detailed reports for business intelligence</li><li>User management</li><li>Auditing</li><li>New forms can be created easily as they are generated from configuration</li></ul><h2 id=technology>Technology</h2><ul><li>Java/Groovy web application</li><li>PrimeFaces frontend (I know this needs rewriting!)</li><li>CDI</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Docker</li><li>Hosted on AWS using Fargate</li><li>Infrastructure created entirely using IaC (Terraform)</li></ul></section></div></body></html>
