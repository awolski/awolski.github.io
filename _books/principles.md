Excerpt

**Where I'm coming from**

You better make sense of what happened to other people in other times and other places because if you don't you won't know if these things can happen to you and, if they do, you won't know how to deal with them.

When everybody thinks the same thing — such as what a sure bet the Nifty 50 is — it is almost certainly reflected in the price, and betting on it is probably going to be a mistake.

...taught me to make sure that no single bet, or even multiple bets, could cause me to lose more than an acceptable amount.

While making maony was good, having meaningful work and meaningful relationships was far better. To me, meaningful work is being on a mission I become engrossed in, and meaningful relationships are those I have with people I care deeply about and we care deeply about me.

[With respect to how tough it is making money in the market] If you are ready to give up everything else and study the whole history and background of the market and all principal companies whose stocks are on the board as carefully as a medical student studies anatomy — if you can do all that and in addition you have the cool nerves ofa  gambler, the sixth sense of a clairvoyant and the courage of a lion, you have a ghost of a chance.
