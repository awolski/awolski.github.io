title: Atomic Habits - James Clear 
---

Atomic Habits is a must read for anyone struggling to maintain good habits or break bad ones. It reinforces the idea that success comes from repetition. You have to show up day-in, day-out, regardless of whether you feel like it or not. The book drives this point home and outlines practical ways to make it more likely you do so, such as environment design and habit stacking. I took so many notes and gained so much from this read. 


## My notes

Success is the product of daily habits - not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.

Your outcomes are a lagging mesure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.

"The score takes care of itself." The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don't have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.

The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It's not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the _process_ that will determine your _progress_.

Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.

Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. Quite literally, you become your habits.

**How to create a Good Habit (The Laws of Behaviour Change)**: 

- Make it obvious (cue). 
- Make it attractive (craving).
- Make it easy (response).
- Make it satisfying (reward).

**How to break a Bad Habit (inversion of the laws)**:

- Make it invisible (cue).
- Make it unattractive (craving).
- Make it difficult (response).
- Make it unsatisfying (reward).

Carl Jung said "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."

Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behaviour.

If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment.

Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.

In the long-run, we become the product of the environment that we live in. 

Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.

Dopamine is released not only when you _experience_ pleasure, but also when you _anticipate_ it.

It is the anticipation of a reward — not the fulfillment of it — that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.

Your brain has far more nueral circuitry allocated for _wanting_ rewards than for _liking_ them.

"The customs and practices of life in society sweep us along." Michel do Montaigne.

Your culture sets your expectation for what is "normal." Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself.

If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection... This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in.

... habits form based on frequency, not time.


...when we remove the points of friction that sap our time and energy, we can achieve more with less effort.

...we should ask ourselves... "How can we design a world where it's easy to do what's right?" Redesign your life so the actions that matter are the also the actions that are easiest to do.

We are limited by where our habits lead us.

The _Two-Minute Rule_ states "When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do."

The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved.

The Cardinal Rule of Behaviour Change: _What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided._

The road less travelled is the road of delayed gratification. If you're willing to wait for the rewards, you'll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.

Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.

A habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits of reinforcement... can offer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is enjoyable.

Perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a _habit tracker_.

Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious. Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive. Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.

This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a habit doesn't matter if the reclaiming of it lasts.

I think this principle is so important that I'll stick to it even if I can't do a habit as well or as completely as I would like.

As Charlie Munger says, "the first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily."

This is why the "bad" workouts are often the most important ones. Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued from previous good days. Simply doing something — ten squats, five sprints, a push-up, anything really — is huge. Don't put up a zero. Don't let losses eat into your compounding.

Don't break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.

Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.

If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviours, then adding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds.

The best way I know to overcome this predicament (repeating bad habits) is to increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behaviour. There can't be a gap between the action and the consequences.

On habit contracts: ...signing the contract was an indication of seriousness. "Anytime I skip this part I start slacking almost immediately."

The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you.

The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilitites. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.

At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.

On successful people vs the rest: The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.

If you only do the work when it's convenient or exciting then you'll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.

Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life.

Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery.

Pat Riley, coach of NBA Championship team L.A. Lakers: "Sustaining an effort is the most important thing for any enterprise."

Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider the possible paths for improvement.

On Eliud Kipchoge: ...one of the greatest marathoners of all time and an Olympic gold medallist. He still takes notes after every practice in which he reviews his training for the day and searches for areas that can be improved.

Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary...

In the words of investor Paul Graham, "keep your identity small." The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you.

Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, and endless process to refine. "If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change."

The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements. It's remarkable what you can build if you just don't stop. It's remarkable the business you can build if you don't stop working. It's remarkable the body you can build if you don't stop training. It's remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don't stop learning. It's remarkable the fortune you can build if you don't stop saving. It's remarkable the friendships you can build if you don't stop caring. **Small habits don't add up. They compound.**
