I'm currently easing myself back into work as my sabbatical / mini-retirement draws to a close. In the meantime I'm re-engineering a system I host for a law firm in Cardiff, making it generic enough for another client who wants to get on board.

I'm also looking into starting an organisation to help with the climate crisis we're all facing. I'm not sure exactly what this looks like just yet, but I'm looking into it.

Finally I'm open to taking on DevOps and automation projects. Feel free to get in [contact](/contact) if you need help or know someone who does.
