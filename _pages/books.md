This page used to be where I kept notes and comments from books I've read. Sadly, I've stopped this undertaking to focus on more important endeavours. Maybe one day I'll resurrect my notes, but for now, I try to write about what I learn from books in my [posts](/).

  <p>{{ item.excerpt }}</p>
  <p><a href="{{ item.url }}">{{ item.title }}</a></p>
{% endfor %}
