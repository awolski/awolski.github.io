It may sound morbid, but it helps me to cull the trivial and shallow from my life, creating more time to focus on what I truly value. Lately, email has been an annoying time thief.</p><p>I am increasingly frustrated with the number of emails I have to process. The newsletters I never read, the feature updates for services I don&rsquo;t use, new terms of service, feedback requests, payment confirmations etc. These messages are informational, unactionable, unnecessary. I don&rsquo;t need or want to see them. So I&rsquo;ve implemented some strategies to stem the flow.</p><p><strong>Remove the source</strong></p><p>If the source of an email is an account I don&rsquo;t use or need, I delete the account. This has now become a game to see how few online accounts I can live with.</p><p>If the message is from, say, a recruiter that can&rsquo;t take a hint, the message is filtered to the trash and they get hit with auto-response:</p><blockquote><p>Thanks for your message,</p><p>I am not currently available for new opportunities. I would appreciate it if you could remove me from, or update my availability details in, the database from which you obtained my contact details.</p><p>Best regards,
Tony</p></blockquote><p><strong>Stem the flow</strong></p><p>If the message is from a source that can&rsquo;t be removed (an account I can&rsquo;t delete or person I can&rsquo;t turn off), stem the flow. Unsubscribe from all notifications. Block the sender if necessary.</p><p><strong>Filter, filter, filter</strong></p><p>There are some notifications that can&rsquo;t be switched off entirely, e.g. payment notifications, terms of service updates, delivery notifications, etc. For these I add the source address to a filter that marks them as read, archives them, and applies the label &lsquo;Filtered&rsquo;.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/2017-09-01-email-notification-filter.png alt="Gmail Filtered Filter"></p><p>To ensure don&rsquo;t miss anything important, I created a weekly calender event with a link to a Gmail search in the event&rsquo;s description. The link below opens Gmail with messages in the &lsquo;Filtered&rsquo; label that arrived within the last seven days.</p><pre><code>https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/in%3Afiltered+newer_than%3A7d
</code></pre><p><strong>Lessons</strong></p><p>These strategies have certainly reduced the amount of manual processing I&rsquo;m forced to do. Last week there were 20 messages auto-filtered, and those obviously don&rsquo;t include emails from the accounts I&rsquo;ve deleted. In turn, my compulsion to check email and to clear my inbox is greatly reduced, resulting in longer distraction-free periods. However I have a feeling this is a stopgap, and doesn&rsquo;t get to the root of the problem.</p><p>Something tells me <a href=https://hbr.org/2016/02/a-modest-proposal-eliminate-email>eliminating email</a> is closer to the answer. Cal Newport suggests as much <a href=http://calnewport.com/blog/2016/03/22/the-case-against-email-strengthens/>here</a> and <a href=http://calnewport.com/blog/2016/07/20/no-email-no-problem-a-workflow-engineering-case-study/>here</a>, and personally I can vouch that the lack of email in the workplace not being a problem: I&rsquo;ve been consulting at a bank for two months and I still don&rsquo;t have a company email address. This suits me fine&mldr; one less input taking valuable minutes from my life, allowing more time for valuable work.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awolski.com/your-choices-shape-your-identity/>Previous</a>
