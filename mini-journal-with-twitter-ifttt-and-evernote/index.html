Friends and family will recollect things that have completely vanished from my memory, and I&rsquo;ll think to myself &ldquo;If only I had jotted something down about that I could go back to and trigger some of those memories.&rdquo; But alas, I never manage to maintain a regular journal schedule; only in fits and starts.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/2014-11-04-ifttt-twitter-evernote-1.png alt=IFTTT-Twitter-Evernote></p><p>One of my biggest problems is that it often feels like a chore to sit down and write a big post about my whole day, especially at the end of the day. And now there are two kids in the mix, time and energy are as scarce as ever.</p><p>So I recently came up with a process that allows me to collect private tweets in a single document that acts like a journal.</p><ol><li>First, I created a Twitter handle with protected tweets (I don&rsquo;t want my journal published to the world).</li><li>Second I set up <a href=https://ifttt.com/recipes/217934-tweet-journal-in-evernote>this IFTTT recipe</a> that, when there is a new tweet from my private handle, appends the tweet in the format Date - Tweet Content - Tweet URL to note in Evernote.</li></ol><p>Now whenever my kids say or do something funny, or I find myself reflecting on the great things in my life, or I have a thought or idea I think would be handy to keep hold of, I simply swipe (or talk) out a tweet or two on my mobile. And now that I&rsquo;ve simplified the process and don&rsquo;t feel like I have to write long updates, I find myself writing a lot more often.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awol.ski/cloudbees-continuous-delivery-summit-part-ii/>Previous</a>
