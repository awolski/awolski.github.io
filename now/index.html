Founded in March 2020 with my co-founder Iván Perdomo, Yvant is a DevOps consultancy that helps its clients run on less, produce more and deliver faster. We&rsquo;ve been busy with setup activities and working with our first client. Things are going well and I&rsquo;m excited for what&rsquo;s in store, not only for us but also for our clients.</p><p>I have also become a teacher (unofficially). I now spend my mornings with my kids reading, doing maths, literacy, topic work and P.E. I also have them learning to touch type.</p><p>I&rsquo;m enjoying the quiet life and quality time with my family that the COVID-19 pandemic has <em>given</em> us. I feel closer to my kids than ever before. We don&rsquo;t have to make decisions about what to do or where to go. I&rsquo;m catching up with my family and friends more than ever on video calls. Movies, reading, exercise, laying about in the garden. It&rsquo;s junk time at its finest.</p><p>Updated 24th April 2020.</p></section></div></body></html>
