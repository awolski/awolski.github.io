In the meantime I&rsquo;m re-engineering a system I host for a law firm in Cardiff, making it generic enough for another client who wants to get on board.</p><p>I&rsquo;m also looking into starting an organisation to help with the climate crisis we&rsquo;re all facing. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what this looks like just yet, but I&rsquo;m looking into it.</p><p>Finally I&rsquo;m open to taking on DevOps and automation projects. Feel free to get in <a href=/contact>contact</a> if you need help or know someone who does.</p><p>Updated January 17 2020.</p></section></div></body></html>
