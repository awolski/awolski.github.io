In Wales, up to six people can now meet up outdoors and in private gardens so, coupled with the wamer weather, we&rsquo;re doing as much in-person socialising as possible.</p><p>I&rsquo;m working with my business partner to turn <a href=https://yvant.io>Yvant</a> into a Co-op and a B-Corp. We want to build an organisation that is socially responsible, profitable and fun to work at. I&rsquo;m also volunteering some time by working with <a href=https://digitalhumani.com>Digital Humani</a>, helping to develop their tree planting API (what they call Reforestation as a Service, or RaaS).</p><p>I&rsquo;ve just finished reading <a href=https://www.calnewport.com/books/a-world-without-email/>A World Without Email</a> and have started down the rabbit hole that so often presents itself after reading a great book. I&rsquo;m now on <a href=https://www.personalkanban.com>Personal Kanban</a>.</p><p>As always I&rsquo;m spending as much time as I can with my kids. It&rsquo;s not always <em>quality time</em>, but quite often <em>junk time</em>, but&mldr; it&rsquo;s <em>time</em>. They&rsquo;re much happier (and so am I) now that they&rsquo;re back in school with their friends.</p><hr><p>Updated 28th April 2021.</p></section></main><footer></footer></body></html>
