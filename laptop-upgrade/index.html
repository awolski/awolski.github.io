Shit. I feel a little bit guilty sometimes for spending so big, because I&rsquo;m pretty <del>tight</del> conservative when it comes to buying stuff (just ask my wife and friends). But as with all purchases this big, I find myself constantly questioning, and then trying to validate the spend&mldr; like I&rsquo;ve got a devil on one shoulder saying <em>&ldquo;go on, you know you want to&rdquo;</em> and an angel on the other <em>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re current laptop is just fine, you don&rsquo;t need a new one."</em> Today, finally, the devil won out.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll love it when it arrives, and the spend will be justified.</p><p>Considering these new Macbook Pros are notoriously difficult to upgrade after you buy them, I maxed out the processor and RAM (3.0GHz Dual-core i7 and 16GB)</p><p><img src=/assets/img/2014-08-18-macbook-pro.png alt="Macbook upgrade"></p><p>Note: I managed to get a bit of a discount through my work&rsquo;s savings scheme.</p><p>My <a href=http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/specs/macbook-core-2-duo-2.4-black-13-early-2008-penryn-specs.html>early 2008 Macbook black</a>, although maxed out on all components (2.4Ghz Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM, 128Gb SSD) and pretty performant for its age, it was beginning to struggle with some of the tasks I ask of it. And it sounds like an Airbus taking off when it starts doing something as simple as playing a Youtube video. Booting up a virtual machine with Windows to remote into work was just plain painful.</p><p>So as I venture into the world of <a href=https://www.docker.com/>Docker</a> and <a href=https://www.vagrantup.com/>Vagrant</a>, and containerising my development and production environments, 16GB of RAM is going to help a LOT.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awol.ski/attracting-the-best-developers/>Previous</a>
