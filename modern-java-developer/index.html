I was pleasantly surprised as I read through the list that I know and frequently use the majority of them:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Confluence</strong> - We use Confluence for <del>all</del> most of the technical documentation at my company; in fact, I wrote an internal blog post a few days ago. It&rsquo;s a nice, intuitive application, and really easy to use. It still feels like it&rsquo;s got a lot of work to go into it - that it&rsquo;s not as polished as JIRA - but the it&rsquo;s by far the best online document management tool I&rsquo;ve used.</p></li><li><p><strong>Git</strong> - As a developer, if you haven&rsquo;t heard about or used Git by now&mldr; where the hell have you been? I use Git for my personal projects, and have been pushing to get it at the my company for quite a while now (we still use SVN - Linus Torvalds gives his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">opinion about SVN here</a>). I&rsquo;m by no means a Git expert, but I&rsquo;m learning more and more all the time. And I can without hesitation vouch for Git&rsquo;s power.</p></li></ol><ol start=3><li><p><strong>Gradle</strong> - I&rsquo;m still in between Maven and Gradle when it comes to build tools and dependency resolution on my own projects. I&rsquo;m really familiar with Maven. I don&rsquo;t need to do anything too fancy or customised with it, the Eclipse plugin works really well with it, and Jenkins builds work out of the box. I do really like the look of Gradle, and have experimented with it both personally and at work. We use Ant + Ivy at work, so I took one of our existing projects and converted it to Gradle as a proof of concept; talk about simplicity. 10 line Gradle scripts replace hundred line Ant scripts + Ivy files.</p></li><li><p><strong>Groovy</strong> - Earlier this year I read Making Java Groovy, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it does things that Java makes hard. I started incorporating Groovy into my projects from then on. My Maven pom.xml files now all use the groovy compiler:</p></li><li><p><strong>IntelliJ IDEA</strong> - I have IntelliJ IDEA installed, and I&rsquo;ve dabbled with it, but I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s my go-to IDE&mldr; yet. After using Eclipse for so long, and knowing it so well, it&rsquo;s going to take time, experimentation, and patience before I can make a bona-fide decision on which IDE is the one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jenkins</strong> - Now this one I know. I&rsquo;ve championed the introduction of Jenkins as the continuous integration tool of choice at the last two companies I&rsquo;ve worked for, and have set up build pipelines that have automated much of what was previously done ad-hoc and manually. There are so many plugins and resources out there to get your builds and deployments humming nicely. I currently use a CloudBees free account to run a build and deployment pipeline for one of my live projects, based on the talk <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=McTZtyb9M38">Real-World Strategies for Continuous Delivery with Maven and Jenkins</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>JIRA and Confluence</strong> - We use this in work. A lot. JIRA is a fantastic product&mldr; I&rsquo;d like to see what type of market share it has for issue management products. I&rsquo;ve no doubt it&rsquo;s an overwhelming majority, because it&rsquo;s just damn good.</p></li><li><p><strong>MongoDB</strong> - Read about it, contemplated using it in a personal project, but not pulled the trigger yet.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scala</strong> - I recently started a Coursera course called <a href=https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</a>. Unfortunately I had to pull the pin after the 3rd assignment as a combination of family (the arrival of my second child) and work commitments meant my time was limited. But not before I recorded 10/10 for the first three assignments. Scala looked promising and I will most certainly invest the time to learn the language going forward.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tomcat + TomEE</strong> - I have a system running on Tomcat for 80+ simultaneous users, and it has been live now for over a year and a half. On top of that, we use Tomcat for development in work, and it has been my go-to servlet container for many, many years. To be honest though, lately I&rsquo;ve been looking at switching to applications running on embedded Jetty instances, and have been reworking a couple of applications to run on the <a href=https://dropwizard.github.io/dropwizard/>Dropwizard</a> framework.</p></li></ol><p>Well, according the the original article:</p><blockquote><p>If you already know more half, give yourself a pat on the back.</p></blockquote><p>Done.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awolski.com/specifying-the-location-of-shiro-ini/>Previous</a>
