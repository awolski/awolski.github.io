I noticed in the class level comment the word &lsquo;Immutable.&rsquo; Having recently read about Google&rsquo;s AutoValue Java library for immutable value objects, I thought I&rsquo;d look to see just how &lsquo;immutable&rsquo; this object really is.</p><p>Unfortunately (for the author), Eclipse code assist immediately pointed out that the class in question is indeed very mutable. How can it be immutable with seven setter methods?</p><p><img src=/assets/img/2015-01-08-mutable.png alt="Immutable&mldr; no"></p><p>You can&rsquo;t call a class immutable when it extends from a parent object that is not immutable.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awol.ski/simple-and-poejava-metrics-with-metrics/>Previous</a>
