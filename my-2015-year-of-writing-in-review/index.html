Not a good start to my writing year!</p><p>2015 is winding down. Em has taken the kids out to a park with a friend and her kids, leaving me with a couple of hours to myself. So I thought I&rsquo;d reflect on the year was, in writing.</p><p>Writing — particularly in the technical arena — was a key focus for me at the start of the year, based on a journal entry I wrote in January. Here&rsquo;s a snippet from that entry:</p><blockquote><p>Writing has the effect of forcing you to understand a topic, and it conveys that understanding to the rest of the (tech) world (or at least the ones that stumble across your blog).</p><p>My goal in 2015 is to completely leapfrog everyone at my company, become the no-questions-asked go-to guy at <em>insert_company</em>, and develop a presence within the worldwide Java community&mldr; even if it&rsquo;s just a very small presence.</p></blockquote><p>In total I &lsquo;shipped&rsquo; 27 blog posts (a few more in draft that I never finished), so I certainly didn&rsquo;t reach the level I wanted to at the start of the year. As I look back over the posts I put out (a list of which is below), I feel a little disappointed in what I wrote about, because they don&rsquo;t convey what I actually spent my time working on, or the technologies I worked with. I&rsquo;ve come such a long way in so many different areas and I&rsquo;m really disappointed that this isn&rsquo;t reflected in the content that I&rsquo;ve shared. Some of the tech I&rsquo;ve spent a great deal of time with this year have been:</p><ul><li>Docker, Docker Machine, Docker Compose</li><li>Cloud Platforms: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Jelastic</li><li>HashiCorp tools: Vagrant, Terraform, Packer and Atlas</li><li>Node.js, NPM and the Node ecosystem</li><li>Atlassian applications: Jira, Confluence, HipChat, Bamboo</li><li>Google Apps (including a great automated user provisioning application using Apps Script)</li><li>Continuing with Groovy, Java, dabbled in Clojure</li><li>Other technologies like Intersystems Caché, MUMPs</li></ul><p>But in a way I feel positive about my progress, and I feel like I&rsquo;ve built a reasonable platform on which to build on in 2016. And on the bright side, even though I&rsquo;m not publishing as many blog posts, I am writing continuously in the form of daily development journals in Google Drive, which has been a really good habit to adopt.

I&rsquo;ve set myself a goal to write everyday. In effect I do this, considering the daily development logs I keep, it&rsquo;s just a matter of pulling the interesting, important, helpful parts out of those daily logs and crafting them into something that is shareable. And I&rsquo;ve got so many other things that I want to share over and above the technical stuff: my progress on a fitness front (which I&rsquo;m really nailing at the moment), the reading I&rsquo;m doing, minimalism and stoicism&mldr;</p><p>There are a few pieces of advice in blog posts that I keep revisiting when my writing wanes and I need some inspiration and motivation to put pen to paper, in the digital sense. A couple in particular stick out, Jeff Atwood&rsquo;s [How To Achieve Ultimate Blog Success In One Easy Step](My theory is that lead generation derives from Google rank and that the best way to increase Google rank is to be like a professional fighter: neither jabs nor haymakers are enough. You must be always jabbing and you must regularly throw haymakers. Blog continuously to keep your hit-rate and link-traffic high and write longer pieces, containing the high-value words associated with your niche, occasionally.) and <a href=http://blog.codinghorror.com/yes-but-what-have-you-done/>Always. Be Shipping.</a>. Both draw references from other posts and articles which are amazing in their own right, but Atwood does a great job of getting across the message I need drummed in.</p><blockquote><p>My theory is that lead generation derives from Google rank and that the best way to increase Google rank is to be like a professional fighter: neither jabs nor haymakers are enough. <strong>You must be always jabbing and you must regularly throw haymakers</strong>.
