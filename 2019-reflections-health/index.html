Initially I landed on a marathon, but in the first few days of the year I ruled it out. Training for the 70.3, although enjoyable and addictive, was time consuming, and I wanted to direct my attention to other endeavours in 2019. On the 4th January my bullet journal reads:</p><blockquote><p>Decision made. Marathon out. Full time work is just too much when your focus this year is building a brand.</p></blockquote><p>I decided to try a simpler approach to exercise: to do something, even if it was only small, every day. 50 push ups, 30 pull ups, 15 minutes of yoga. Just try to not break the chain.</p><p>In total I hit 289 days of exercise from a possible 365, a strike rate of 79%. I&rsquo;m usually really tough on myself, and I&rsquo;m disappointed I didn&rsquo;t reach a round number like 300 days, or 80-90%. But viewed from different perspective I averaged over 5 ½ days per week, which is, in retrospect, a reasonable accomplishment.</p><p>Irrespective of how many days I did, I hit the end of the year feeling fantastic. I felt strong <em>enough</em>, fit <em>enough</em> and flexible <em>enough</em>. My focus was on the process and not the end result. I stopped comparing myself with others, how fast I could run compared to X, how much I could lift compared to Y, what I was doing or what I looked like compared to Z. It became all about putting an X down each day. The result? A much happier me, both physically and mentally.</p><p>Funnily enough, by focusing on the process rather than the end result I ended up with the six-pack that has eluded me for 40 years; but I didn&rsquo;t really care about it.</p><p>As I explained in my post on <a href=/habit-tracking>habit tracking</a>, I tried to iterate on the following cycle for my workouts:</p><ol><li>Four rounds of max pull ups, interspersed with max hanging leg raises</li><li>Four rounds of max push ups, interspersed with max crunches</li><li>Four rounds of pistol squats, interspersed with a timed static bridge hold</li><li>Running, usually 5-10km</li><li>Yoga, usually 20 minutes</li></ol><p>It&rsquo;s surprising the progress you can make by focusing on small changes, and repetition. At the start of the year I could only manage 12 pull ups, 23 push ups and 3 pistol squats. By the end of the year I had hit 23 pull ups, 45 push ups and 13 pistol squats.</p><p>A powerful thing to do is to combine your exercise with your commute or errands you need to run. It&rsquo;s a great way to kill two birds with one stone. Walk, run or ride to work. Throw a backpack on and run or walk to do your errands, rather than jumping in the car. On so many days when I really didn&rsquo;t feel like doing a workout, my chain was kept in tact by an errand I could (literally) run to, or deciding to run to and from work.</p><p>Atomic Habits played a huge part in how I approached the year in health and fitness. For example, I&rsquo;ve always struggled with snacking on rubbish around the house. Crisps, chocolate, ice cream; you name it, my willpower won&rsquo;t resist it. I&rsquo;ve tried numerous approaches to knock this on the head throughout the years, but I always end up slipping back into old (bad) habits. This year I applied one of the approaches outlined in the book, to implement a contract. I asked my family to sign a contract that said if &lsquo;snacked on shit&rsquo; throughout the month then I would owe each of them £50. They were happy to sign it because it was no skin off their noses.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/2020-01-17-2019-reflections-health-contract.png alt="No Shit Contract"></p><p>The funny thing is that while the contract was in place I didn&rsquo;t even think about eating crap. It was as though my brain knew subconsciously that it wasn&rsquo;t an option, and didn&rsquo;t consider it. Now after Christmas and holidays I&rsquo;m back to my usual bad habits, but at least I know I&rsquo;ve got that up my sleeve.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awol.ski/artificial-environments-of-scarcity/>Previous</a>
