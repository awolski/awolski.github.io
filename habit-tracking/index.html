The knowledge I&rsquo;ve gained reading Atomic Habits combined with my Bullet Journal habit tracker have helped me cultivate good habits and eliminate bad habits that I&rsquo;ve struggled with for years.</p><p>I keep it simple and commit to a maximum of five habits each month, but rarely more than four. I find I lose focus and get overwhelmed if I try to do too much. I use the columns in my Bullet Journal&rsquo;s monthly collection, one column for each habit I&rsquo;m tracking.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/2019-09-13-habit-tracking.png alt="Habit Tracking"></p><p>Exercise is a mainstay habit this year. I&rsquo;m following Atomic Habits&rsquo; advice and aiming for consistency. I use small routines that last for no more than 20 minutes and don&rsquo;t require any (minimal) equipment.</p><ol><li>Four rounds of max pull ups, interspersed with max hanging leg raises</li><li>Four rounds of max push ups, interspersed with max crunches</li><li>Four rounds of pistol squats, interspersed with a timed static bridge hold</li><li>Running, usually 5-10km</li><li>Yoga, usually 20 minutes</li></ol><p>Taking into account illness and forced days out I hit an 80% strike rate, completing 197 workous of a possible 244 days. This is a vast improvement on any other time in my life. I&rsquo;ve always struggled to maintain any sort of consistency, finding myself in the motivated-then-can&rsquo;t-be- bothered cycle many people do.</p><p>Daily reflection is another ongoing habit I&rsquo;ve cultivated. Every morning and every evening I spend 5-15 minutes either planning or reviewing, or both. A description of my complete process is for another blog post, but I can&rsquo;t stress how important it has become. It keeps me on track and working towards what I&rsquo;ve pre-defined as the most important things in my life, and helps me make adjustments where necessary. It also forces me to acknowledge the little wins I&rsquo;ve had during the day, something I&rsquo;ve never done enough of being particularly self-critical.</p><blockquote><p>One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress — Atomic Habits</p></blockquote><p>Other good habits I&rsquo;ve cultivated and bad habits I&rsquo;ve eliminated that I can attribue to habit tracking are:</p><ul><li>Flossing — I floss every night.</li><li>Gratitude — Every day I write down two things I&rsquo;m grateful for.</li><li>Offline evenings — I put my phone and laptop away before I put the kids to bed each night. I spend most nights reading instead of being sucked into staring at a screen.</li><li>Meditation — I meditate first thing every morning for 20 minutes.</li></ul><p>And finally, had it not been for habit tracking and the motivation I get from not wanting to miss: writing. I&rsquo;ve committed to publishing two blog posts each week, on Tuesday and Friday. It&rsquo;s now 21:33 on Friday night. Had it not been for habit tracking I would have postponed this post, and probably never written it. Now I get to click publish, keep the chain unbroken, and hopefully in the future see the results compound.</p><blockquote><p>Small habits don&rsquo;t add up.
