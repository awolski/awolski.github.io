In 2019 I started to Bullet Journal. It has been the single most powerful thing I've done this year. It provided the platform I desperately needed to get offline, gain clarity, and stay on top of things. No other system or combination of systems (and I've tried many) has worked for me before.  My Bullet Journal has been the backbone of everything I've done this year.

I recently had an email from a reader asking whether I thought keeping a Bullet Journal might be beneficial to him. I was quick to give it my endorsement, but I wasn't able to express everything I wanted to in the email I wrote to him, so I thought I would try to here. Maybe 

When I have problem I grab my journal, some quiet time and space and write about it. I write about it, ask myself questions, and answer them. This process helps me to get clear, to put things in perspective.

Gets me offline

Nothing slips through the cracks anymore

I've got a valuable record to look back on.



Things it's helped me achieve in 2019:

- Finally get a will done.
- Pull the trigger on my 40th year sabbatical
- 


When I've got a problem, I find time to sit down and work through it, 

Bullet journalling is a clear, succinct system to keep your tasks organised.


My process

### AM Reflection

One of the first things I do each morning is AM reflection. I open my Bullet Journal to the next blank space, write the date at the top left, the time I woke top right, and then my habit trackers for the day. Gratitude, food and exercise trackers have been staples this year, but if I'm focusing on anything else for the month I'll write it down too.

I then write down anything that's on my mind... something that's popped up overnight, a short note about how I slept, or thoughts about something significant I've got on that day. Sometimes I write paragraphs, even pages, but other times my mind is pretty clear and I only manage a sentence or two.

When I start a new journal I write my AM reflection process in the first page so I've got it immediately available as a reference. I've referenced it so much that it's solidly embedded.

- Unload your thoughts, clear your head, offload anything that's bubbled up overnight.
- Review all the pages in the current month to remind yourself of any open tasks.
- Clarify your priorities and plan accordingly
- Review weekly plan

### Throughout the day

Throughout the day I'll jot down tasks that need to get done, thoughts that pop into my head that I think are relevant, things that are going well, things that have gone wrong, how I've dealt with them, funny things the kids have said, events that have happened. Sometimes these are short bullets only, but often I'll elaborate a little (or a lot), capturing my thoughts, feelings and emotions, and any details I think are important.

### PM Reflection

In the evening, usually after we get the kids to bed or when I hop into bed, I close out the day with a PM reflection. Depending on how tired I am, I'll bullet the main events of the day, the things I did, and write down my thoughts or feelings. I note anything that's bothering me, problems that arose, how I dealt with them. This is a good time to ask myself questions like "What went well today?", "what didn't go so well?", "What can I improve?", "How could I deal with that better?" I also try to acknowledge ways in which I've 'won the day'. I think this is important, as it's easy to focus on the negative, and it's refreshing to force myself to look at all the things I did well.
 
 Like my AM reflection, I have the process written down on the first page of each new journal:

- Scan what you've logged during the day
- Mark completed tasks with an X
- If a task is missing, write it down, unburdent your mind
- Once updated asky Why? for each item..
  - Why is this so important?
  - Why am I doing this?
  - Why is this a priority?
- Strike out taks you deem to be irrelevant
- Acknowledge your progress, the sim ple ways you've won the day.

### Weekly Migration

I find that if I leave migration to the end of the month there is too big a build up of open tasks, and it takes too long in AM reflection to scan through a month's worth of pages to remind yourself of them. After 30 days of doing so you're very familiar with those open tasks anyway. For this reason I like to do a weekly migration.

A weekly migration consists of scanning through my pages for the previous week and transferring anything that's still relevant to the fresh page for Monday. This is a good opportunity to cross out anything that is no longer important.

### Weekly Reflection

Typically on a Monday morning I create a 'Weekly Reflection' page. I scan through the previous week's entries, noting anything that sticks out such as patterns, lessons learned, achievements, things that went well, and things that didn't.  

I find that a weekly reflection closes the feedback loop, which is too long if only done once per month. The patterns and lessons I extract on a weekly basis provide valuable input guidance for things to correct and build upon in the coming week.

Weekly reflection also feeds into weekly planning (below).
