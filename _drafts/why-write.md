I've found it increasingly difficult to write consistently. Writing is something I want to do. Why? Because I'm inspired by people who I read who do so. Cal Newport.

Is every one of their articled particularly profound? No. Sometimes they're nothing more than an observation from a book they're reading that relates to something they're working on or interested in.

So what's stopping me from doing the same? I read. I highlight. I ponder.

You need to take note of what you've highlighted recently from one of your Kindle books and turn it into a blog post.

What was it that you read recently? That people are interested in reading about other people's struggles, and how they've solved problems, or are at least attempting to solve problems. Some of the most interesting blog posts I've ever read have been random thoughts about a particular topics. Or opinions.

Would I be interested in a blog post about someone's fitness regime, the struggle they're on? Probably not. I more interested in discovering improved ways of doing things. Life hacks. Like if someone came up with a routine that has been working for them.

So really, why is it that I want to write? What do I think writing will give me? Is writing just one more item from my life that needs to be removed?

So back to my original question; why do you want to write?

* I admire the people that do write. They all seem to be successful, driven... they've all produced something worthwhile and valuable in the world. It seems they're writing has opened up opportunities.
* I think it will lead to a passive income. How is it going to create a passive income if you don't monetise the website on which you're writing - and you don't want to advertise.
* It will certainly clarify my thoughts on the subjects I write about.
* It will increase my marketability in the technical world. It may lead to interesting and lucrative contracts.
* It helps me organise my thoughts on a subject.

So what is my blog post today going to be about?

* The workout I did today
* How I've discovered that less is more... that removing unnecessary things from your life is an order of magnitude better than trying to become more productive.

# Removal is better than productivity

Although I'm only 37, I'm starting to become acutely aware that there's only I finite amount of time we have in our lives. That's a morbid way to start a blog post, I know, but there is a context. After years and years of trying to be more productive, efficient, and get things done, it's really starting to sink in that it's often better to not get stuff done, than to try and get stuff done more productively. Less is more.


I say this in the context of how much we try and fit in. I've discovered that instead of working harder to become more productive, more efficient, and getting more things done, it's actually better to learn to remove.

I don't keep a list of TODOs anymore. If something is urgent it will pop back into my conscious mind. I trust my mind to take care of that.

Is it really necessary? If I were to get to then end of my life and this thing that seems so urgent I have to keep it in a list is still not done, how would I feel?

For example, there's a paint tray in our garage full of screws, nuts, bolts... random metal bits and pieces that have accumulated over the years as we've renovated our house. I've had a task on my mental todo list for years now to go through and organise all of those bits and pieces into some screw organise trays that I've bought. Now, is it really going to add value to my life to get that particular chore done? If I really think about it, the answer is a resounding no; the only thing doing that task will achieve is removing a few hours from finite amount of time I have left. So this is an example of something I can remove from my life, and be freer, have more time as a result.

One of the things I've been trying to minimise lately is the amount of email that lands in my inbox.

Hearing about [insert some examples about those that don't use email at all].

In the line of work I'm in it would be impossible for me to remove email completely

Lately I've been discovering more and more that instead of finding ways to be more productive, you're better off removing it from your list of things to do, because chances are it's not really necessary. For example, I really identify with Cal Newport's ideas around email... whether it really adds to our productivity or whether we're just slaves to it (better, find some quotes from his recent emails around this topic). So I've been trying to reduce the amount of email I receive. I unsubscribe from a large proportion of the messages that land in my inbox. But I still feel like I can do better. Updates about AWS webinars? They should probably go.

One in particular is the bank and credit card statements I receive. I've recently taken to acting on these, by logging into online banking, downloading the monthly statement, renaming it and storing it in my Google Drive filing system. After all, you never know when you might need a bank statement from 5 years ago. But when I think about it, how often have I need a bank statement from 5 years ago? I would hazard a guess at... never. I can always log on to internet banking and download one from the last year if I need to apply for a loan or a credit card. Is taking the time and effort to save these statement really going to be worth it in the long run?

 I honestly don't see me browsing over old bank statements when I'm 50, 60, 70...
