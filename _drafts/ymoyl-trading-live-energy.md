I've just completed step 2a of Your Money or Your Life, which is to establish (accurately and honestly) how much money I am trading my life energy for, and discover my _real_ hourly wage. What the hell does all that mean? Let me try and make it a little clearer.

One of the key concepts in Your Money or Your Life is that of **_life energy_** which is our finite allotment of time on Earth. Money is something we choose to trade our life energy for. When we go to our jobs are trading our life energy for money

> while money has no intrinsic reality, our life energy does... It's tangible and it's finite. Life energy is all we have. It is precious because it is limited and irretrievable and because our choices about how we use it express the meaning and purpose of our time here on earth.

So I sat down and started working through the task. First I created a spreadsheet with the list of things that you don't consider being part of your job. Things that take time that you need to do, things that take time because of your job. For example... how long is your commute? How much wear and tear does your commute put on your car? Do you buy lunches and coffees that you normally wouldn't if you had the time to prepare them at home? Etcetera.

The basic calculation is to work out how much you earn in a week, divide it by the number of hours you work in the week, and you have your hourly wage. For example, if you earn £800 per week and have 35 hours contact time in your job your hourly rate should be £22 per hour. But this is before you factor in all the costs in time and money that are job-related that we don't consider. The theory  in Your Money or Your Life says that your _real_ hourly wage will be a lot less than this once you factor in all the job-related costs you normally don't consider.

I considered my last contracting gig to be pretty good in terms of commute, convenience, flexibility with working hours, dress code. It was a great place to work. I could ride to work in 15 minues, run in 20 and walk in 45-50. There were secure lockers for bikes and belongings, flexible working hours. In the end it was dress down every day. There was a lot going for it, so I didn't expect to encounter too many unconsidered costs associated with it compared to, say, a commute to the next biggest city, which would include time on public transport and the cost for the tickets, extra time for the kids in childcare, more formal work clothes etc. I had a pretty sweet deal (it was tough to leave!). 

I'm not currently working (for money) so I used the figures from my previous contract. Weekly earnings four seven-hour days, 28 hours, at £450 per day equals £1800, so my hourly rate,

**_Original hourly rate £1,800 (per week) / 28 hours (per week) = £60 / hour (TODO)_**.

Then I began working my way through the list, assigning a time value to activities that I could attribute to my job, like my commute, the time getting prepared at either end. The cost in wear and tear of my bike (servicing), trainers etc. Work (business) clothing, holiday costs that could be avoided if I had the time and energy to do research and look for deals instead of leaving it all until the last minute, time spent studying outside of work hours to improve my prospects and earning potential.

For example, whether I used to run and ride in twice a week each, with the occasional walk to break things up. The time it took me to get into and out of my gear at either end practically doubled the time it took, so I attributed 45 minutes per trip, 1 hour 30 minutes per day, for a total of 6 hours per week. This alone brought my real hourly wage down to 

I was playing the conservative game, because I didn't want to skew the figures too much. I wanted to walk away from the task with an honest appraisal, something I was confident in, that this was what I was really trading my life energy for. For example, where I might be more inclined to go out for a drink at lunchtime on a Friday at work, and have proof in the pudding with my bank statements that this was costing in excess of £15 per week, I'd put down a £10. Same for lunches out, coffee, team meals... everything. I went on the conservative side.

But this is where things started getting interesting. I had the _real hourly wage_ calculation plumbed into my spreadsheet so each time I entered a value into a job-related time or money cost the _real hourly wage_ figure came down a notch. Initally by only a little, but as I worked my way through the sheet — bearing in mind I was playing extremely conservatively — the figure kept plummeting. By the time I was comfortable I'd accounted for everything **_my real hourly wage had plummeted to less then half of what it started at_**.

The goal of the task is not to dissuade you from working. A purely time/money focused calculation like this doesn't factor intagible benefits to working like human contact and social interaction (other benefits to working). This task is more aimed at making you realise how much you're really earning when you factor in all these other costs. This can then be used, instead of a monetary figure, when deciding what to purchase with your hard earned money. Now, instead of thinking about your purchases in terms of purely the monetary cost, you can translate it into **_how much life energy you're tradiing for the things you buy_**. For example, I plugged in my new realy hourly wage into my financial spreadsheet — where I track every cent that comes into and out of my life — to get a view on how much things have been costing me... Airport parking for our trip home to Australia 5 hours. Digital content 1 hour. This all leads to later steps of the book where, on a monthly basis, you analyse whether you're getting real benefit vs life energy you're spending in obtaining some of these things. Some you might be, and might possibly even want to spend more of your life energy if they bring real value. Others, well, then you've got clear evidence that it doesn't align with your values or your not getting real benefit, so you can look to reduce those categories.

The purpose of this post was two fold. First, to document my experience with this particular step of Your Money or Your Life. Second, was to highlight how far askew we can be when evaluating what we earn vs the time and money we spend in earning it. The result of factoring in all of this additional time and monetary cost might just completely change your view on whether what you currently do for a crust is truly worth the life energy you're trading for it.
