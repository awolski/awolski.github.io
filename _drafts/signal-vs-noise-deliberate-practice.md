Lately I've been really conscious of distraction in my life. I'm starting to notice it everywhere. Derek Sivers recent posts on having a private email address. Cal Newport's posts on on Digital Minimalism, see example blog posts here and here. And Ryan Holiday's recent release Stillness is the Key (which I'm yet to read). Maybe it seems like it's everywhere, or maybe it's that the places I choose to look are becoming more focused.

I'm not sure whether other people just aren't as affected by it as me, or whether they are and they just don't see it as a huge problem. I think for me it is more prevalent because recently I've been reading books like So Good They Can't Ignore You and Deep Work, which emphasise the importance of carving out long periods of uninterrupted time to do rare and valuable work, which is something I'm interested in doing. I've done it before, and those were the most satisfying and rewarding periods in my life thus far. And for which I got the greatest rewards. Deliberate practice.

For example, when I was hell bent on making the representative football team in my U18 year I spent the whole summer with a football in my hand. I did all the fitness work prescribed... I didn't miss a session, something I don't think too many others did. I would spend hours down the local cricket field kicking the football into the whiteboard. Sprint, pick out a spot on the white board, drill the ball at it, react and sprint to pick it up cleanly, quicly jam it on the boot as quick as I could trying to snap it back through the whiteboard, which now acted as goals, collect again, jog back and do it all again. And again. And again. Right foot, left foot. Faster, cleaner, better. My skills went through the roof that summer, and I went on to make the team. And I got selected for the national championships.

Another example was when I was trying to translate a mountain of Chef scripts that built eHMP. To cut a long story short we just weren't able to get the system working in its entirety, and even if we did it would be an arduous task for other developers to do the same. So we decided to reverse-engineer the Chef scripts so we could build Docker images. It took a couple of months of daily grind, long hours of focus to work out what the scripts were doing, migrating them to build Docker images, resolving issues etc.

My point is that it was the times that was working the hardest and smartest, lost in deliberate practice, which stick out in my mind as the most satisfying and rewarding. Yes they were hard at the time, but pushing through that difficulty was also joyful, something reiterated in numerous studies on flow (dig this research out of So Good They Can't Ignore You and Deeep Work). Which is why it is important to me to be able to carve out time to go deep, do deliberate practice, and hit flow. But it is becoming increasingly difficult in our hyper-connected world.

Some of the practices I've adopted often seem strange, even plain crazy, to those around me. Who only checks email once a week? Who doesn't have WhatsApp? Who...? All of these choices are made with the intention of getting better at what I do, going deep.

What's the point of the post? What are you trying to tell yourself?

I'm trying to highlight that the most satisfying times in my life have been those when I've done the work. I had a clear vision of what I wanted and did deliberate practice to reach those goals. They were the most satisfying in my life. And now it seems more and more difficult to achieve those levels of deep work, deliberate practice.
