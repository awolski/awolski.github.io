I'm not entirely sure what this post is about yet.

I'm sitting at my desk reading various blog posts about planning your week in advance. I'm also trying to work out what what my weekly reviews should look like.

Reading over my notes on _The 4 Disciplines of Execution_, it's clear that my objective shouldn't be anything official. Rather, it should be an informal look back at the week that was to celebrate the success I'd had, understand why I'd not been successful, and identify actions to take to ensure that I don't have a bad week coming up.

>The 4DX authors elaborate that the final step to help maintain a focus on lead measures is to put in place “a rhythm of regular and frequent meetings of any team that owns a wildly important goal.” During these meetings, the team members must confront their scoreboard, commit to specific actions to help improve the score before the next meeting, and describe what happened with the commitments they made at the last meeting. They note that this review can be condensed to only a few minutes, but it must be regular for its effect to be felt. The authors argue that it’s this discipline where “execution really happens.”

>During my experiments with 4DX, I used a weekly review to look over my scoreboard to celebrate good weeks, help understand what led to bad weeks, and most important, figure out how to ensure a good score for the days ahead. This led me to adjust my schedule to meet the needs of my lead measure—enabling significantly more deep work than if I had avoided such reviews altogether.

So what went well?
