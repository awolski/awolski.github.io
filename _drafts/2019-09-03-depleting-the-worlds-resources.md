From Your Money or Your Life, page 10:

> Competing nations have depleted our planet's common resources. Everything we eat, wear, drive, buy and throw away comes from the earth. Many of these products are fabricated from nonrenewable rexources. Once we throw them away, those pieces of the planet will not be available to support meaningful life for perhaps thousands of millenia. It's a one-way trip from Earth to factory to store to our house to the dump. We have ignored the fact that we enjoy our current level of affluence by the good (and free) graces of nature — soil, water and air that cost nothing yet are being taxed to the limit. We now face the grim possibility that the earth may one day no longer support life as we know it and need it to be. As civilized and advanced as we may have become, we still depend on breathable air, potable water and fertile soil for our daily existence. But we have done massive, perhaps irreparable, damage to our planetary support system.

Page 15: 

> The survey has proved conclusively what has long been held theoretically to be true, that wants are almost insatiable; that one want satisfied makes way for another. The conclusion is that economically we have a boundless field before us; that there are new wants which will make way endlessly for newer wants, as fast as they are satisfied... Our situation is fortunate, our momentum is remarkable.

Page 16:

> Our enormously productive economy... demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption... We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever increasing rate.

What books can I find about this subject? It is fascinating and may help me find a solution to the gift giving (consumer) culture we currently suffer from.

This whole first chapter of Your Money or Your Life strikes a huge chord with me. It resonates deeply.

Page 17:

> We have absorbed the notion that it is _right_ to buy — that consuming is what keeps America (insert nation) strong. If we don't consume, we're told, masses of people will be thrown out of work. Families will lose their homes. Unemployment will rise. Factories will be shut down. Whole towns will lose their economic base. We _have_ to buy widgets to keep (insert nation) strong.

> Part of why our "consumers" have less money to spend is that saving has clearly become un-American. Even the language of modern economics promotes consumption.
