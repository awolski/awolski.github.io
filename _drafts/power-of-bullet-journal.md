In 2019 I started to Bullet Journal. It has been the single most powerful thing I've done this year. It provided the platform I desperately needed to get offline, gain clarity, and stay on top of things. No other system or combination of systems (and I've tried many) has worked for me before.  My Bullet Journal has been the backbone of everything I've done in 2019.

I recently had an email from a reader asking whether I thought keeping a Bullet Journal might be beneficial to him. I was quick to give it a glowing endorsement, but I was unable to express everything I wanted to in my response to him, so I thought I would try to here. Maybe it might be of use to other people too.

**A Bullet Journal is so flexible**. It can be whatever you need it to be. Because it is just a notebook. Do you want to journal randomly? You can do that. Want to draw? You can do that. Track your habits? Schedule events? Undertake a project? Plan? Reflect? You can do all of those.

If a feature is missing from a digital system you have to find what you need elsewhere, or bend it to achieve what you want. I don't have to use one system for one thing, and another system for another. Because it is paper based, and very flexible, you can use it for pretty much anything you want. 

I used to try to manage tasks in email, task management systems, in a calendar. It was always difficult to know where to put what. And I also wanted to journal, so there was another tool to manage. With a Bullet Journal, I've got one notebook, that's it.

**It gets me offline**. gets me offline and gives me the time and space to think, plan, reflect without any distractions. Throughout the course of this year I've come to realise just how important this is. When my phone or laptop available I tend to get sucked into browsing, looking for something to occupy my attention. I realised how totally incapable I am of controlling those urges through reflection in my Bullet Journal. So much so that I've now implemented a totally device free evening policy using Freedom and WiFi cut outs from 17:30 - 06:00.

I can grab my Bullet Journal and a quiet moment anywhere. I don't need to charge it (although I do need to make sure I've got backup pens in case the one I'm using runs out of ink). I really value the times when I can sit down reflect, brainstorm a problem I'm working through, or let my thoughts run away with me, free from the appeal of online distractions. 

**Nothing slips through the cracks**. The combination of the daily catch-all, frequent reflection and a flexible organisation system means very rarely do I miss something that needs to be done. When something pops into my head I jot it down. Every day, in the morning and evening during my AM and PM reflections, I'm quickly scanning everything I've noted, so I'm always aware of what's important (and what's not). I'll have to ask my wife on this one, but I'm pretty sure I've been on top of everything this year like no other.

**It's a valuable record**. Ryder Carrol says that in a Bullet Journal you've got your own personal biography (autobiography?). I doubt I'll spend much time in future years looking back through my old journals, because I rarely look back through old photos. But already this year the patterns, lessons learned and achievements I pull out each month have been so valuable. When doing monthly reflection I've noticed that I've made the same mistakes over and over again, and so have made it a priority to implement a plan of action to correct anything that has come up more than once. With daily notes, events, task capture, thoughts etc. I've got a pretty accurate record of what I was doing, eating, thinking, feeling etc on any given day this year. Even if not for me, maybe my kids might find it amusing one day.

Could I do these things without Bullet Journalling? Are these things really that important? What if I stopped Bullet Journalling?

We forget things we've read in books. We forget lessons we've already learned. We make the same mistakes over and over. Unless we revisit, reflect and internalise. It is only when we revisit and reinforce that things, and people, become stronger, more permanent parts of our lives. This is why Bullet Journalling, or journalling in general, is so powerful. It forces you to reflect, revisit, reinforce. It helps you see what is happening around you. To observe... the world around you and you yourself.
