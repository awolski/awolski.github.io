I constantly found myself thinking about how I can teach my kids about the power of deliberate practice. When I was growing up, the idea that people were born with innate talent, that if you were not becoming the best was not possible, was the status-quo (wrong terminology). I even considered myself talented in football and various other endeavours. Having read Peak I now see my ability in these areas was probably a result of the time that I spent watching and playing with my brother. We used to spend hours kicking a football together. There was a street light in the middle of the island in our cul-de-sac. We'd stand opposite sides of it, kicking back and forth, seeing who could hit the post most often. Without know it we were undertaking deliberate practice.
