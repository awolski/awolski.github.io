Here is a list of things I've removed from my life in recent times that I worried about before doing so:

Deleting Facebook
Deleting LinkedIn
Deleting WhatsApp
Removing comments from my blog
Checking email everyday
Reading then news. Listening to it on the radio
Blog and email subscriptions to technical content I thought was important.

In each and every case there was a voice saying "There might be something important you miss. You'll miss social events. You'll miss job opportunities. You'll miss conversations. You'll miss out on connecting with interested people. You'll miss important emails. You'll miss knowing what is going on in the world. You'll miss technical news and updates."

But the reality is there is more than enough in my life already. More important stuff. I don't miss.

I don't miss hours of my life being ripped from my scrolling through a Facebook feed.
I don't miss job opportunities. If I don't know about it, how can I miss it? And I've got enough work on my plate as it is.
I don't miss 

I gain...

Hours looking at and playing with my kids, reading books... in place of scrolling through a Facebook feed.
Concentrate on solving problems in the work I have, and building a business, rather than being distracted by job opportunities that might be there.
Quality one on one conversations with people I love than the barrage of group conversations going on and having to be kept up with.
Not having another thing to manage, respond to, check.
Focus on big, important goals and work rather than constantly being distracted by the urgent that pops up.
Ignorance... it's bliss. Nothing that has happened in the news in the last few months (not that I know what it was) has affected me so much that I'd be better of had I known about it hot off the press.
Clarity. When I need to find a solution I do dedicated research.

Sure, sometimes I might not know about an event that is being organised on Facebook or WhatsApp. But the important ones always tend to make their way into my sphere of knowledge. People find a way to you. If they love you, they'll find you. Because they want you to be there. And if not... well, what does it matter? If you don't know about it, it can't hurt you. You've got enough going on in your life already. Look at it as though it was one thing you didn't have to say no to... the world did it for you.

We fear we're going to miss out. We don't. Not on the stuff that really matters. I'm still in contact with my friends. The love for them, and the love I experience in return, is still there.

I get to miss out on all the noise. There's enough noise in my own life without copping it from everyone else's.

I'm putting email in its place. I'm not a slave to it.

News. I'm not a slave to what's going on in the news.

If it's not a categorical "This is really important to me, I must have it in my life", err on the side of removing it.
