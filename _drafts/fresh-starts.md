title:  "Fresh starts"

I love fresh starts. Clean slates. Blank pages.

I used to love starting a new school year. I loved opening new, untouched notebooks. Each one gave you the opportunity to get things just right, no mistakes, no wonky ruled lines, perfectly laid out. You had the opportunity to lay things out differently, more cleanly, or to try a new handwriting style (wording). To create a new schedule, one that will work this year. You didn't have to try and rectify all the mistakes you made last year. You could forget about them and start again, leave them behind. The opportunities, the vision, the clarity... it was palpable, raw, exciting, invigorating.

Starting afresh gives you hope. It opens up possibilities to what might be. It lets you think about the mistakes you made in the past, really think about them, and design solutions so you don't make the same mistakes again. 

It allows you to experiment and try something new. This is exciting. Maybe (probably) the experiments won't work, but in attempting your teaching yourself. You're learning what doesn't work so you get closer to what does. And then you get to try again. And again, and again. This is how we learn, by doing, making mistakes, and fixing them.

It's an iteration, a constant cycle of design -> act -> reflect -> design -> act -> reflect. 

Isn't that what life is, an iteration? Day in, day out, the sun rises, the sun sets. You can view each day as 'just another one'... to get through, a burden (wording), the drudgery. Or you can view each day as a blank page. An opportunity to forget about what happened before the sun rose today, and all the days that have gone before it. You get to bring all the lessons you've already learned and look at this day as a blank page... something to grab with both hands and make the most of. 

This is one of the reasons I love bullet journaling so much. Because each day I get the opportunity to start again. I give myself a blank page, a clean slate, a fresh start. I force myself to think about what isn't working, and think about how to resolve those issues. But with bullet journaling you give yourself that opportunity more often. Each day, each month. Each new notebook. Plan. Do. Reflect.

Maybe this is a metaphor for life. Everyday can be a clean slate if you choose. An opportunity to do things differently. To get out of the rut that you're in. To try something new. It's a fresh start. A clean slate. A blank page. Grab it with both hands and make the most of it.

With Bullet Journaling I get the same feeling more frequently. The closest I get to the feeling is when I start a new notebook. But also when I start a new month in the same notebook, or a fresh page or spread for a new day or collection.
