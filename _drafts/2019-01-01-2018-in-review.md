The curtains have closed on 2018, so it's time to dust off the journals and reflect on the year that was.

# Had a year off alcohol 

My only goal in 2018 was to take a year off alcohol, and I'm proud to say that I achieved it. I had my last alcoholic drink on 4th January 2018. I found the process easier than I expected, although there were times when it was tough, moments when I wanted nothing more than to dull my feelings with a glass of red. But as with with anything in life there are trade-offs. What I've gained from giving up alcohol far outweighs what I've lost.

# Got fit

A crucial part of taking a year off alcohol is having a challenge to focus on. I chose a 70.3 (half ironman), which I completed in September and wrote about [here](). My preparation also included the Cardiff Triathlon (Olympic distance) and Velethon Wales (140km ride). The training was time consuming and at times tough, but I really enjoyed it. Looking back, I'm proud of even starting the 70.3 because injuries threatened to derail my attempt. A groin issue early in the year and IT Band problem prevented me from running for months at a time.

# Became debt free

In my early thirties I set myself a goal to be entirely debt free by the age of forty. In September I ticked the box. I can't say that doint so has been as profound an event as I'd envisioned, but it has without doubt given us more freedom and flexibility in our working lives. Being debt free has taken the pressure off whilst my wife and I attempt to launch our own businesses.

# Deleted all social media 

2018 was the year I deleted all my social media accounts: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn. I even deleted my Gmail account in an attempt to reduce the influx of messages I have to process. Before canning these accounts I spent far too much time worrying about the potential impact doint so could have on my social and professional life. Did any of those fears materialise? No. I keep in contact with the people I care about most with calls, direct messages and in person catch-ups. My professional career is fine; I can only do one job at a time.

# Learned

What did I learn in 2018?

- The fear of losing things from our life is just that, a fear. They say that we expand to fill the time and space available to us. I've found this to be so true. My mind would create so many What if's? as I thought through deleting my Facebook GMail accounts, or stopping drinking.. That I'll become a social leper. That I'll lose contact with all my old friends.  Did any of these fear eventuate? No. I learned that I don't need them as much as my fears lead me to believe. I still keep in contact with my closest friends (although a goal of mine in 2019 is to do more of this). It's about removing the things from your life that don't add real value. To do that you need to identify what's important to you. Is 30 minutes scrolling through Facebook feed, past countless ads, clickbait and fake news important to you? Would that 30 minutes be better spent on the phone to someone you really care about?

There are so many inputs into our lives. Too many for me to cope with. I get overwhelmed with the sheer number of things that surface each day. I often think WTF! How do I stop the influx. I spend all this time strategizing on how to plug holes and it still keeps coming

Do less. Focus on one or two key aspects.
