1. Define a clear purpose

> To enter the flow state, you need a goal. Decide what you want to create and why. Vague intentions donâ€™t trigger the flow state.

2. Identify a compelling motive

> Why does this task matter to you personally? What difference will it make if you can be creative? Why do you care?

3. Architect a worthy challenge

>

4. Provide a conducive environment

> Phone on no interruptions. Headphones on listening to calm, focus sounds from your mobile. Internet off your laptop.

5. Allocate a committed block of time

> Ideally 3 hours. But when do I get 3 hours?

6. Prevent interruptions and distractions

> Early morning

7. Master your tools

> My tools are my laptop and a blank editor
