But to be sure, I wanted to revisit it later, hence the clip to Evernote. I&rsquo;ve just re-read it now, and it is. So many great nuggets of <del>information</del> experience to draw on from people who have been there, done that. It&rsquo;s the sort of article you just want to stick on your development manager&rsquo;s desk and with a note saying &ldquo;this is how we need to be developing, deploying, delivering.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=microservices-advantages>Microservices advantages</h2><blockquote><p>Small independent microservices can be built using the technology best suited for their requirements. No longer does every application component need to be built on a common company-mandated language and framework such as Java/Spring or Ruby on Rails.</p></blockquote><p>Or insert your enterprise stack here. It&rsquo;s true. With a monolothic architecture, developer&rsquo;s are constrained to using the stack that somebody decided years and years ago, which may not be the best way to do things now. Just try and re-architect it&mldr; yeah right, it&rsquo;s just not going to happen. Microservices make sense in this respect, in that it allows developers to experiment with new and better fitting technologies for small components, that aren&rsquo;t going to break <em>everything</em>.</p><h2 id=speed-wins>Speed wins</h2><blockquote><p>Rapid software delivery is the most important factor for success, and thus, effort spent in streamlining this is effort well spent. Microservices drastically improve the time required to push out a new update, allowing a much more agile development process.</p></blockquote><p>Read that again dev manager.</p><blockquote><p>Trusting developers, and promoting a culture of freedom with responsibility not only reduces software delivery times and increases success rates, but also has the side effect of improving workplace culture and employee retention.</p></blockquote><p>And that.</p><h2 id=process-is-scar-tissue>Process is Scar Tissue</h2><blockquote><p>process is usually based on old and legacy ways of doing things. As a result, it rarely adapts to new requirements, is often complex and burdensome, and brings with it all sorts of baggage like training and documentation overhead. To an organization delivering software, process is &ldquo;scar tissue&rdquo; and should be removed.</p></blockquote><p>And change is difficult to introduce in an organisation that is entrenched in process&mldr; I know from experience. But unless you have buy-in and investment from the very top, process is very difficult to remove.</p><h2 id=invert-conways-law>Invert Conway&rsquo;s Law</h2><blockquote><p>Conway&rsquo;s Law&mldr; states that &ldquo;the interface structure of a software system will reflect the social structure of the organization(s) that produced it.&rdquo; So if we start off with a company that&rsquo;s complex, costly to run, fragile, inflexible, mired-in-process, and bureaucratic, guest what? We&rsquo;ll end up with software that has the same characteristics.</p></blockquote><p>This article is definitely worth a read, particularly if you work in an organsation that is mired in legacy processes and with monolithic application architectures, or if your working towards a more agile and microservices architecture.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be forwarding it on to our development manger.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awol.ski/laptop-upgrade-part-2/>Previous</a>
