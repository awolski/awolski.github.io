The mundane tasks and chores that need to be done on a day-to-day basis are complete, and no longer stand the way — as obstacles or excuses — of me finishing the activities that are vital to my growth and success, e.g. meditating, reading, writing, exercising.</p><p>This <em><strong>clearing-the-obstacles</strong></em> routine has contributed hugely to the success I&rsquo;ve had in my personal development endeavours over the past few months. Clearing the decks by doing all of the &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be bothered, I&rsquo;ll do it tomorrow&rdquo; chores like washing up, clearing the kitchen, putting out your workout clothes etc. pays <strong>massive dividends</strong> when it comes to getting the important things — the vital few — done each day.</p><p>For me clearing the obstacles means:</p><p><strong>Clearing the kitchen</strong> — I make sure I&rsquo;ve washed and dried, or put in the dishwasher, any dishes that are still out. Everything that I&rsquo;m not going to be using in the morning should be in its place and out of sight.</p><p><strong>My WOD is prepared</strong> — I write tomorrow&rsquo;s WOD on the whiteboard in the garage, including calculating the weights I&rsquo;ll be lifting from the prescribed percentages. I prepare all of the equipment for the first set of exercises and pull down the rower so that all that&rsquo;s left to do is walk out to the garage and start warming up.</p><p><strong>Everything is laid out for the morning</strong> — I put out my workout gear for my WOD, a glass of water, toothbrush and toothpaste for the <a href=http://halelrod.com/006/>five step snooze-proof wakeup strategy</a>. I make sure a mug is out and the kettle has enough water for my first cup of coffee (to reduce the chance of waking everyone up with taps running and cupboards banging). I also put out the kids&rsquo; beakers for milk, nutri-bullet cups&mldr; basically anything I <em>will</em> need in the first hour or two of the morning.</p><p>The effort of preparing for tomorrow the night before is like investing on regular basis; the compound interest will build and build until one day you&rsquo;re a millionaire (successful).</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awolski.com/2016-mini-review/>Previous</a>
