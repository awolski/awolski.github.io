Getting involved in community discussions, forums and social media. Responding to more questions on <a href=http://stackoverflow.com/>Stackoverflow.com</a>. Contributing to an open source project (I&rsquo;m still yet to choose which one(s)). I also started open sourcing some of the work I&rsquo;ve been doing in my spare time.</p><p>As a result of open sourcing one particular <a href=https://github.com/awolski/client-api>project</a> on <a href=https://github.com/>GitHub</a>, I was contacted by <a href=https://stormpath.com/>Stormpath</a>, asking if they could feature my project on their website.</p><p>Stormpath is:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mldr; a User Management API specialising in Authentication, OAuth, Custom User Data, SSO and Authorization. A Complete User System. In Minutes.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s really easy to get up and running, and removes the need to develop a huge part of an application (User Management) that is necessary, but not part of the business logic.</p><p>Just quietly, I was pretty stoked. Stormpath organised a phone interview to go through my web application, and to see how and why I was using their API for user management and security.</p><p>After a few months of no contact I thought they must have moved on to bigger and better things, but a little over two weeks ago they emailed again with a draft of the blog post (to which I eagerly gave the thumbs up). Early last week the write up went live! You can view the entire article here: <a href=https://stormpath.com/blog/exploring-microservice-architectures-with-stormpath/>Exploring Microservices Architectures With Stormpath</a>.</p><p>The concept that the more you give, the more you get in return, is a strange concept to grasp. And it&rsquo;s one that has taken me a long time to realise. But I can&rsquo;t believe how powerful it really is. I&rsquo;ll certainly be giving to the Java and developer community a lot more in the future.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awolski.com/code-faster/>Previous</a>
