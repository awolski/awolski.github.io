It has been in production use ever since.
The system allows the firm to rapidly take details of clients who are purchasing or selling a property, and automatically calculates fees such as stamp duty and land taxes. Quotes are calculated on the fly so agents can give clients accurate, real-time view of what the purchase or sale will cost.</description></item></channel></rss>
