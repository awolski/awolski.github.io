It didn&rsquo;t matter what they were, I just had to ship something. The intention, I kept reminding myself, is to build the habit of writing, and not to worry about the quality of what I&rsquo;m putting out. If I kept at it, by the end of September I&rsquo;d have eight posts under my belt. By the end of the year, thirty-six. In ten years time, if I maintain the same schedule, I will have published over a thousand posts, and by then I will have improved and, in the process, learned a thing or two about writing.</p><p>It has been anything but easy. Tuesdays and Fridays have been tough slogs, consisting of long hours spent writing and rewriting, and then rewriting some more. I find it an arduous task to put into words what I&rsquo;m finding interesting and learning, all the while trying to block out the fear of <em>what people will think</em>. I have to keep telling myself I&rsquo;m writing for me, not for anyone else.</p><p>And then life goes and gets in the way. You&rsquo;ve got this thing that you&rsquo;re committed to but along comes a day when the weight of the world is on your shoulders, the universe urging you to lay down and give up. A headache. A sickness. An argument with your partner. Whatever. The last thing you want to do is <strong><em>get to work</em></strong>. This is how I feel today. It&rsquo;s Friday and I have to ship, but the last thing I feel like doing is sitting down to write.</p><p>But on my walk home I remembered two things I read recently which compelled me to type out these words. The first was something James Clear wrote about in <a href=books/atomic-habits>Atomic Habits</a>.</p><blockquote><p>This is why the “bad” workouts are often the most important ones. Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued from previous good days. Simply doing something — ten squats, five sprints, a push-up, anything really — is huge. Don’t put up a zero. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding.</p></blockquote><p>The second was pretty much everything I read in <a href>The War of Art</a></p><blockquote><p>The amateur, underestimating Resistance&rsquo;s cunning, permits the flu to keep him from his chapters; he believes the serpent&rsquo;s voice in his head that says mailing off that manuscript is more important than doing the day&rsquo;s work.</p><p>The professional has learned better. He respects Resistance. He knows if he caves in today, no matter how plausible the pretext, he&rsquo;ll be twice as likely to cave in tomorrow.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe with time these lessons will fade and I will once again become the person that postpones or lets excuses win out. But not today. Today I choose to turn up. I may have problems on my plate, and it may be incoherent drivel I&rsquo;m putting out, but today I&rsquo;m putting two index fingers up to the universe accompanied by a big <strong><em>fuck you!</em></strong> I win. I don&rsquo;t submit. Today I&rsquo;m not the person who lets life or circumstances get the better of him. Nope, today I&rsquo;m the person that publishes a blog post on a Friday.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awolski.com/year-without-alcohol/>Previous</a>
