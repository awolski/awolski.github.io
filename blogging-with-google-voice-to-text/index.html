There just seems to be so much going on in life: family life, kids, work, trying to get a side business off the ground, maintaining some level of fitness by doing a WOD 4 to 5 times a week, let alone all the day to day things that need to get done. Even getting up at 5am, there&rsquo;s only ever an hour or so at the end of the day before I go to bed at 10pm, during which I&rsquo;m usually getting some coding or reading done.</p><p>So I got to thinking, how can I &ldquo;hack&rdquo; my way to achieve my goal of blog posting 5 times per week when time is so limited? Squeeze in an hour at work? Write before I go to bed? I was coming up short with viable options.</p><p>Then last Friday my new Oneplus One arrived. I played around with it for most of Friday night, and then off and on over the weekend. One thing that I discovered worked amazingly well that I&rsquo;d never really used before is Google&rsquo;s speech to text functionality. I was gob-smacked at how easy it was to use, and how accurate it was. I soon began to wonder whether it could be the answer to my non-blogging dilemma.</p><p>So I &lsquo;typed&rsquo; out this post using it&mldr;</p><p>But I honestly only had to correct misspellings or mis-hearings 6-7 times. And I spoke this post in a hushed voice (so as no to wake the kids), from my bed, at 21:45 on a Sunday night.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still getting used to it, so I&rsquo;m no expert just yet. I found a reference to some of the many <a href=http://android.stackexchange.com/a/66331>punctuation commands</a> you can just say, like &ldquo;New line&rdquo;, &ldquo;period&rdquo; and &ldquo;comma&rdquo;, and Google voice to text just spits out what you want.</p><footer>&#171; <a href=https://awolski.com/mockito-javadocs-the-best-use-of-javadoc-ever/>Previous</a>
